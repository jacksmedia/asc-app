# **Blue List**

The following is a list of all Blue magic, the best monster to learn it from, and the location.  
**NOTE**: Not all methods of learning these spells are listed, but rather the earliest location and best monster to learn them from. I did not list Oni (previously Dark Force) in Kefka’s Tower, which uses every Blue magic spell on this list minus Beam, Quasar, and Quick\!
