# I. Overview

This guide is a walkthrough to mostly cover changes made to FFVI \- A Soldier's Contingency.  In particular, it focuses on lost-forever items and rages, new secrets, missable content, and tips for beating the new monsters/bosses. This guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of the original game. If you need a guide that shows you something like “where to go next”, I would recommend [Djibriel's FAQ](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gba/930370-final-fantasy-vi-advance/faqs/51030), although there are plenty of other guides online.

NOTE: This guide is based on the default difficulty level. If you use the insane or mild difficulty levels, some of the stats give in this guide won’t be exactly the same (HP of the monsters for example).  However, the tips and strategies remain the same, and so do the lost-forevers, steals, drops, treasures, and more.

# II. Gameplay Changes and Notes

The following is a quick list of major changes from the original game that might effect how you play. There are countless other additions and changes, but these are the bigger ones:

* You can now Sprint at any time while holding the cancel button, but you can dash even faster with sprint shoes\!  
* Classes are a bit more defined: ONLY Mages can use espers and magic, while all other characters will rely on their special skills.  
* Espers no longer grant status boosts upon leveling up. As such, there is no need to rush through the game at a low level, unless you want to.  
* Much of the previous missable content is no longer missable. This is explained more throughout the walkthrough.  
* The back row only reduces damage received by 25% instead of 50%, so it's not as much of an advantage (but still worth putting mages in the back row). Warriors should go in the front row most of the time. It should be noted that Cyan’s Bushido and Sabin’s Blitz are often affected by row.  
* Most equipment has gone through changes to make them more useful. Much of the gear is now specific to select characters, especially later in the game. For example, Heavy armor is sometimes only equippable by warriors.  
* Ribbons no longer block Petrify. Jewel Rings, Safety bits, and other such relics will do this only.  
* Guns are now the primary weapons for Setzer and Locke. Guns are not strength based, and are NOT affected by the characters level. They deal random damage and ignore defense\!  
* Setzer’s Slots have been “unrigged”, which means you can use some strategy to get a match\!  
* Mog's dance will never fail. In addition, Mog’s dances have been improved a lot\!  
* Umaro is now equippable, and you can now control him.  
* Genji Gloves are not equippable by mages, while Gauntlets are.  
* Phoenix Downs and life spells no longer kill undead monsters.  
* Vanish is now only a learnable Blue magic spell.  To protect characters, Image is used instead (only works temporarily). The Fenrir Esper is your friend in the World of Ruin\!  
* The Chainsaw no longer attempts an instant death move against monsters immune to it, but the chainsaw can occasionally miss. The Drill is 100% accurate, which sometimes has an advantage.  
* Items/Equipment will no longer teach spells, and Rods can't be used as items, but they grant other benefits while equipped.  
* You can now control characters at the Colosseum.  
* You no longer lose your item upon failing to win at the Colosseum (everyone just resets the game anyway, right?). Instead, you only lose the item upon winning when it is traded for the new item.  
* Some spells that previously damaged both the monsters AND your own party have been modified not to do so (Merton, Vortex, Crusader, to name a few). Quake still damages both parties, though.  
* Shock can be used only once per battle (for free), and randomly chooses between 3 different attacks.  
* The Tintinabulum will heal the entire party with each step now.  
* The Steal command works with Imps/Pugs.  
* Major bugs like Vanish/Doom, Psycho Cyan, and dozens more have been fixed.  
* Runic will last the entire battle or until it us used to block a spell.  It no longer expires after one turn.  
* Retort will also last the entire battle or until used, just like with runic.  
* There is in fact some new dialog scattered around various towns, and not every NPC says the same thing they used to \- especially in the WoR.

# III. Walkthrough

## World of Balance

**Narshe, the beginning:**

**Monsters:** Lobo, Were-Rat, Repo Man, Vomammoth

* The start is a tad harder than the original game, but not by much. Move Terra, Biggs, and Wedge to the back row immediately, and use repair when necessary, since it costs no MP to use.  
* In the first cave area, the only monster you may encounter is Were-Rat.  
* Once you have Terra by herself in the cave area, you may encounter Were-Rat and Repo Man.  
* You can skip the treasure chests in the Narshe caves to get upgraded items in the World of Ruin as in the original game, although there are no lost-forevers if you get them now.

**Locke and the Moogles:**

* One new feature you may notice about Locke right away is his "Throw" command. This will make Locke a much more useful character\!  
* With the Moogle scene, keep in mind the Vomammoths are more difficult, but they drop a tonic every battle. Use these tonics to heal between battles.

**Marshal:** This battle is just like the original. You can bring Locke to steal the "Kunai Darts", which is a new throwing weapon for the "Throw" command (you can also purchase them soon).

With this fight, you might consider killing the Lobos first. Even though Marshal will deal more damage with both Lobos dead, it still winds up being less damage than all 3 attacking you. After that, finish off Marshal.

**NOTE:** Marshal no longer appears in the Veldt (no boss will appear in the Veldt anymore).

**Figaro Castle:**

**Monsters (outside):** LesserWolf, Dark Wind, Areneid, Sand Ray

* Make sure you take a nap or heal before the cutscene with Kefka. The M-Tek Armors are more difficult, so entering the battle with low HP might prove difficult.  
* Feel free to grab all treasures in Figaro Castle. There are no lost-forevers here.

**Figaro Cave (after Kefka Cutscene):**

**Lost-forever Monsters:** Bleary, Crawly, Hornet \- make sure to encounter Bleary, as it will be lost forever after the Raft Ride. Gau starts with the Hornet and Crawly rages, so don't worry if you miss them.

* Treasures in the cave become better if you leave them for the WOR.

**South Figaro:**

**Monsters (outside South Figaro):** Mu, Goblin, Gigantoad (Rhinotaur is no longer found here).

* The treasures in the outside areas become better in the WOR if not picked up now. Nothing is lost-forever, though. Take them or leave them.  
* I recommend fighting just enough monsters outside town to buy enough items to prepare for Mt. Koltz \- otherwise Vargas might be difficult.  
* I recommend purchasing a handful of Kunai Darts for Locke to make Vargas easier to defeat.

**Note:** You can no longer raid the basement treasures in the clock room, since a dog will block your path.

**Mt. Koltz (Recommended Party Level 8-11):**

**Monsters (cave area):** Cave Ape, Tusker

**Monsters (outside areas):** Funguar, Cirpius, Hornet

**REMINDER:** Running through the game on a low level no longer has any advantage, as Espers no longer grant status boosts upon leveling. Gain as many levels as you need, although there should be no need to grind too much with some good strategy.

**Vargas:** This is more difficult this time around. Have plenty of Healing items before fighting him, and don't forget to place characters in the back row. Have Terra use cure every turn until the Ipooh's are dead, then only use it after Vargas casts Gale Cut for the rest of the battle. Don't forget to have Locke throw those Kunai darts if you purchased any.

**Sabin Recruited:**

* It should be noted that Sabin’s physical blitz attacks are affected by row as of version 2.0 of ASC.  As such, you need to put Sabin in the front row if you want his blitz attacks like Pummel and Suplex to deal full damage. If you aren’t sure which blitz attacks are affected by row, be sure to check “Blitz” in the skill menu to read the description of each blitz move. This is also a good way to learn which blitz attacks are magic based and which are physical.

**Returner's Hideout:**

**Monsters (Outside Returner’s hideout):** Red Wolf, Knocker, Rhinotaur, and Funguar \- these monsters are a new batch of monsters that are different from outside South Figaro.

* You can still get the Genji Glove by saying "No" to Banon 3 times here, or by saying "No" to him once and talking to the man inside \- but keep in mind Terra cannot equip the Genji Glove. If you get

the Gauntlet, she can equip it. Most people might still choose the Genji Glove just because they are harder to come by, and more characters later can benefit from them. 

* I would purchase plenty of potions here since they will be handy coming up...  
* It might be wise to have Banon gain a level or two outside the Returner's hideout before tackling the raft ride, although it IS possible to beat at a low level.

**Raft Ride (Recommended Party Level 9-12):**

**Monsters:** Pterodon, Piranha, Nautiloid

* It is wise to put Banon in the back row\!  
* Save in a different save slot before jumping on the raft. Ultros is harder now, and there is no way to backtrack if you are ill-prepared.

**Ultros:** He has a bit more HP than before, but the usual strategy will win here. Have Banon heal every turn (and possibly Terra as well if your level is low), and have Edgar use Tools and Sabin use Pummel.

**Choose a scenario:**  

Although any order is fine, I recommend starting with Terra, Edgar, and Banon. I would then do Locke second, then finally the Sabin scenario.  This is only because it enables you to get more rages with Gau during his scenario\!  There are no lost-forevers if you choose a different order, however.

**Banon, Terra, Edgar Scenario:**

**Lost-forever Monsters:** Hobgoblin, Vaporite \- In the new sections of the caves of Narshe, you will encounter these two. They are available until the WOR, then they will be gone.

**Other Monsters:** Lamentor, Warlock \- in the security checkpoint

* Note that Lamentor and Warlock encountered at the security checkpoint can also be found on the Phantom train. Also, you may re-visit the security checkpoint in Narshe until the WOR.

After that, these monsters are lost-forever.

* I recommend skipping the treasures in the Narshe caves yet again, as they are better in the WOR.

**Locke's Scenario, South Figaro:**

**Monsters (town area):** HeavyArmor – will also be encountered in Sabin’s scenario and the battle at Narshe.

**Lost-forever Monsters:**  Vector Pup, Grunt – it’s pretty much impossible to miss these monsters (in the basement after recruiting Celes), but keep in mind it is now impossible to return back here once you finish with Locke’s scenario\!

* If you don't have any, I recommend purchasing a few Kunai darts at the weapon shop in South Figaro. They come in handy against Tunnel Armor.  
* In the basement where you recruit Celes (in the long hallway), don’t forget the secret stairs. The “dungeon” area contains the Hermes Shoes and Hyper Wrist. These can be obtained later, but are pretty good at this time.  
* Make sure to find the Halcyon sword in the monster area, as it is Celes's best sword for a while.  It can technically be found through other means later, but will be pretty useless by then…  
* Don’t miss the second set of secret stairs in the monster room. There is a Magic Armlet and Ribbon. More Ribbons can be found later, but this is the earliest one (and incredibly useful).

**NOTE:** You cannot return to these areas anymore once you complete Locke’s scenario\! Unlike the original game, your path will be blocked.

**Locke's Scenario, Figaro Caves revisted (Recommended Party Level 11-14):**

**Monsters:** Gold Bear, Hermit Crab, Primordite \- Gau starts with Hermit Crab and Primordite, but Gold Bear is lost-forever if you don't fight it before the WOR.

* The treasures here are slightly better than the first visit, but are even better in the WOR like before. There are no lost-forever treasures, however.

**Tunnel Armor:** Pretty much unchanged from the original game. Celes should use Runic, and Locke should attack or use his "Throw" command. If you picked up a Bolt Edge in the treasure chest in the South Figaro basement, you can use it here for around 1,000 damage. 

**Sabin's Scenario:**

**Monsters (outside imperial outpost):** Sprinter, CrassHoppa, Stray Cat

* Stray Cat should be encountered here for Gau to rage at the veldt. Although not as overpowered as the original game, it is still one of the best rages this early in the game.

**Shadow:**

* Shadow is recruitable as of version 2.0 of the hack. I highly recommend doing so, as it will make life easier than having Sabin by himself. You cannot equip Shadow with anything, but he is powerful enough with what he has. Shadow no longer leaves the party at random like he did in the original game.  
* You don’t have to purchase throwing weapons for Shadow since he comes equipped with unlimited Kunai Darts, although they WILL cause slightly more damge if thrown versus used as a weapon.

**Imperial Base:**

**LOST FOREVER Monsters:** Telstar, Rottweiler \- make sure to walk to the tent during the Kefka scene to encounter Telstar. Rottweiler can also be encountered in the battle at Narshe if you miss it.

* The treasure chest that you either kick or hit has a peace ring in it.  Equip this on Sabin before you fight Telstar.  
* Rottweiler (previously Doberman) can be encountered if you "kick the chest", but you may also encounter Rottweiler in the battle at Narshe if you decide to hit the chest instead.

**Cyan Recruited:**

* One change you should notice immediately about Cyan is his much faster Bushido (previously Swdtech) bar. In general, his special moves are also far more balanced than before.  
* Cyan’s physical bushido attacks are now affected by row in ASC 2.0, just like Sabin’s blitz. As such, if you are using moves like Dispatch and Quadra Slam, you need to have Cyan in the front row to deal full damage. If you aren’t sure which Bushido moves are physical based vs. magic based, be sure to check the descriptions in the Bushido skills menu.

**Heavy Armor:** In the magitek armor sequence, you will face a Heavy Armor. This guy is tougher than your average M-tek armor, although you should still have no trouble. Your reward for beating Heavy Armor is a Bolt Edge for Shadow and/or Locke to use later. I would save this for the battle at Narshe coming up.

**Leader:** Leader vs. Cyan fight can be a challenge if you don't take it seriously. I would put Cyan in the back-row and have him use retort to counter with mass damage.

**Monster: Telstar (monster-in-a-box):** This will be difficult if Sabin does not have a Peace Ring or Ribbon. The Black Belt is a decent choice for the 2nd relic slot so Sabin can counter any soldiers called in by Telstar. Use potions if you have to, and consider placing Sabin in the back row if you are really struggling with this fight.

**Sabin's Scenario, Phantom Forest:**

**Monsters:** Ghost, Lamentor (you can return here any time until the WOR).

**Sabin's Scenario, Phantom Train (Recommended Party Level 12-15):**

**LOST FOREVER Monsters:** Keeper, Wight, Skeleton, Shadow, Bomb \- You can find Bomb in the overworld map with the airship in the giant forest north of the Veldt, but the rest are lost forever.

Warlock and Lamentor can be found here if you missed them at the Security checkpoint at Narshe, but you can also return to the security checkpoint at any time until the WoR.

**TIP:** The Dark Bomb (the monster-in-a-box) is easier to kill with Cyan's Stock Break (previously Slash) Bushido. The Dark Bomb CANNOT be found on the Veldt or raged by Gau.

**Ghost Train:** Phoenix Downs no longer kill the, but you can use Cyan's Stock Break to inflict mass damage. Besides that, just use Potions on your characters as needed, bring back a dead Sabin or Cyan with Phoenix Downs, and have Sabin use Pummel or Fire Dance. If you have Shadow, have him throw any Kunai Darts you purchased.

**Sabin's Scenario, Barren Falls:** 

Beware of Rizopas this time around\!  Rizopas now has 2,000+ HP, and is not a fight you want to take lightly. Have Cyan use Quadra Slam, or if he doesn't have it yet, Dispatch or Retort. Have Sabin use Pummel, and possibly give him a Black Belt to counter Rizopas.  Keep healthy with potions throughout the battle. The real danger here is El Nino, which Rizopas will use below 384 HP. If you know Rizopas is getting low on HP, DO NOT let him linger\!

**Sabin's Scenario, Gau and the Veldt:**

* The most important change with Gau is his ability to learn rages anywhere. The Veldt now only exists to encounter those monsters he missed\!  
* Before progressing, I recommend finding some of these rages for Gau: HeavyArmor, Stray Cat, Templar, Pterodon, Keeper.  
* Don't forget to send the letters for the soldier to obtain the Tintinabulum\! It will heal the entire party with each step now, and can later be bet at the Colosseum for something much more rare...  
* It would not be a bad idea to find a few Telstars on the Veldt to obtain more Green Berets. They are very useful for the battle at Narshe to beef up the HP of low level characters.

**Sabin's Scenario, Serpent Trench:**

**Monsters:** Aspik/Odd Eyes, Sea Flower/Sea Horse, Anguiform \- it should not be possible to miss any of these monsters, but I'm not 100% sure about that.

* Stick to the right path on this part, so you can claim the Venom Claw in the treasure chest for Sabin.  It is incredibly useful for the upcoming battle at Narshe.  
* Have Gau rage Rhinotaur in this section, since it will absorb Gigavolt and use megavolt – a weakness for most monsters here.

**Sabin's Scenario, Nikeah**

* This is a great place to stock up on last-minute items before the battle at Narshe. I also recommend purchasing a Mythril Pike for Edgar.

**Battle at Narshe:**

**LOST-FOREVER Monsters:** ScoutArmor, Fidor, Trooper, HeavyArmor, Rottweiler, and EliteTroop \- In particular, EliteTroop is lost-forever if you pass him up and fight Kefka.

**NOTE:** It is theoretically possible to miss some of the monsters mentioned here, although the chances are very slim of that happening. You can encounter ScoutArmor, Trooper, and Rottweiler by talking to the soldiers at Vector later if you miss them here.

* Every time you defeat a HeavyArmor, you will obtain either a Bolt Edge or a Fire Skean. Have Locke throw these against tougher formations, especially when you are in trouble\!   
* My personal recommendation for the party battling Kefka consists of Sabin, Terra/Celes, and Locke/Edgar. Another good combo would be Cyan, Gau, and Sabin – although healing with Potions will likely be necessary.

**Kefka:** If Kefka gives any trouble, send in Sabin with a Venom claw and Black belt. The attacks and counter attacks should bring Kefka down fast.  Celes is valuable for Runic, and will stop most of Kefka's powerful spells. If you are on low levels and struggling to win, you might consider placing four people in one party while another party consists of just one person that never does any fighting (Locke maybe). One of the 4 party members should be Terra or Celes, so they can cure other members and/or bring them back to life.

**Narshe:**

* As of version 2.0 of the hack,you can recruit Shadow if you bring only 3 characters. This is the last time you will be able to recruit Shadow, but it’s up to you. He is pretty strong.  
* Feel free to grab whatever treasures you want in Narshe (none of them upgrade later).  
* I recommend purchasing at least 3 of each piece of Mythril gear (the shield, helmet, and vest).

**Kohlingen:**

* As stated above, you may recruit Shadow if you only brought 3 characters. He charges 3,000 gil, but is probably worth it. His level will match those of your characters, and he has a very good normal attack.  
* It might be wise to purchase throwing weapon here like Shurikens and Kunai Darts. Shadow and Locke can both use these.

**Monsters (outside):** Warg, Sahagin, Ogre, Trilium/Mandrake, FossilFang

* Be careful fighting Ogres outside Kohlingen. I recommend using Edgar's noiseblaster to confuse them. Also, you might not want to stick around the desert outside Kohlingen, or you just might encounter a FossilFang. They will likely wipe you out at this point, unless your levels are higher...  
* I recommend fighting just enough monsters outside Kohlingen for gil to get the better gear found at Narshe, Kohlingen, and Jidoor. Otherwise, Zozo will prove difficult.

**Zozo (Recommended Party Level 13-16):**

**Monsters:** Zozo Gigas, Iron Fist, SlamDancer, Harvester, Bandit

* There are no lost-forevers here since you can revisit anytime in the WOR. Zozo Gigas is a nice rage to have in the WOB.  
* Zozo Gigas can be a threat. Do NOT confuse him, or he will use Quake\! Instead, stick to poison based attacks. Venom Claw for Sabin, BioBlaster or Drill with Edgar, the Were-Rat & Trilium/Mandrake rages with Gau, Ice2 with Celes (if she is at level 15), or Stock Break with Cyan (which cuts HP in half) are good attacks to use.  
* Steal some rare Dragoonboots from Harvesters and Gigas Gloves from Zozo Gigas if you have Locke and want them in your inventory.  
* In the weapons store, there is a Flintlock pistol \- a new gun weapon type. Guns will ignore defense, but the damage is very random, and they can miss. To ensure 100% hite rate, use the Sniper Sight\!

**TIP:** Harvesters are a bit more rare than before, but give you lots of gil. After all, they DO have a sack of goodies slung over their shoulder...

**NOTE:** The Chainsaw no longer attempts an instant kill on monsters immune to death (hooray\!). That being said, it is not 100% accurate anymore, so it might miss against monsters with high evade. The Drill is 100% accurate and will never miss \- thus offering some usefullness even after getting the Chainsaw. The Chainsaw will likely be your go-to Tool a vast majority of the time, but the Drill may actually be better at the very end of the game against bosses with high evade.

**Dadaluma:** He has more HP this time around, so be ready to use a few Phoenix Downs and Potions. If you attack Dadaluma twice with magic, he will throw a knife and proceed to jump. If you use "Fight" on him 4 times, he will throw a few knives at your party. You might consider avoiding magic attacks and "Fight", and instead rely on Edgar's Tools, Locke's Throw, Cyan's Bushido, or Sabin's Blitz.

If you want to use just one spell on Daduluma, I recommend poison at the start of the battle, which he is weak to (although he cannot be poisoned).

**Opera House (Recommended Party Level 13-17):**

**Monsters:** Rat King, Vermin \- lost-forever if you somehow manage to avoid all the rats in the rafters before Ultros, which is highly unlikely.

* It might be wise to purchase some potions before this segment for the upcoming Ultros fight, since you won't have Celes to heal your party.

**Ultros:**  I would have Locke use potions on party members low on HP while the other members attack. Use Quadra slam with Cyan, Chainsaw/Drill with Edgar, Rhinotaur/Stray Cat/Heavy Armor/Templar/Pterodon with Gau, and Blitz with Sabin. Although this fight is a bit longer than before, it shouldn't be overly difficult.

**Southern Continent:**

**Monsters:** Wyvern, Dingo, ChickenLip, Water Hag, Vulture, FossilFang, Vespula

* Note that Wyvern, Dingo, and FossilFang are nice rages for Gau.  
* Each town has a few unique pieces of equipment that you may want to purchase.  Albrook has a Tiger Mask, Vector has a Gale Bow, Tzen has Mythril Mail and Amulet, while Maranda has the Sage's Miter and throwing weapons for Locke. I recommend purchasing some of these items before the Magitek facility.

**Magitek Facility (Recommended Party Level 15-20):**

**LOST FOREVER Monsters:** Mega Armor, ProtoArmor, Sentry, Commando, Hybrid Dog/Cyberhound \- although some of these monsters can also be encountered by talking to troops in Vector/Imperial Base.

**Note:** ProtoArmor and Mega Armor are in the lower floor of the Magitek facility. Both of them are good rages at this point\!

* Ramuh is your friend here\! If Celes didn't learn Bolt2, consider summoning Ramuh while up against monsters like ProtoArmor and Mega Armor. Ramuh does more damage than Bolt2 as well.  
* Rhinotaur is a great rage for Gau, since it uses Mega Volt and will absorb Tek Laser.  
* There are some good treasures here, including a Beam Gun for Locke. It should be noted that if you give Locke a Genji Glove, he can equip two guns which is pretty devastating\!  The Gold armor set found in the treasure chests are nice for Edgar and Celes. The Thunderblade is useful for Celes, since nearly all monsters here are weak to it.

**Magitek Facility pt.2 (Esper room, Staircase, and Test Tube area):**

**LOST FOREVER Monsters:** Flan (Esper Room), General, Trapper (Giant starcase), Cygnus, RocketMech (Test Tube area)

* Beware of using bolt spells on RocketMech, as they will retaliate in a bad way\!

**Number 024:** This fight is a bit harder, but still quite easy with some strategy. Use Blitz, Tools, or Bushido for defense piercing moves (Pummel, Chainsaw/Drill, or Dispatch), or take notice of which Element the boss is attacking with, and use the opposite against him. Number 024 has 10,000 HP this time around, so it will take a little while to win.

**Magitek Facility pt.3 (Mine Cart Ride):**

**Monsters:** Red Roader, Mag Roader \- The Red Mag Roaders (now called Red Roaders) are impossible to miss now, at least they should be... Same with the purple Mag Roaders.

**Number 128:** This is mostly the same as the original game. You can steal a Tempest for Cyan from the body, although there are more than 2 in the game now (Much later you can purchase them in the WOR).

**NOTE:** Weapons like Tempest no longer have a special effect with the Offering, so don't go thinking you will be able to get 8 Wind Slashes in a row with a Genji Glove and x2 Tempest swords. You CAN still get two Wind Slashes in a row with a Genji Glove and x2 Tempest swords, however\!

**Escaping the Magitek Facility:**

**LOST FOREVER Monster:** Chaser

* Don't forget to encounter Chaser on your way out, although it shouldn't be hard to find it.

**Setzer recruited and Cranes:** 

* You may notice right away that Setzer has permanent GilToss.  This is useful against the Cranes if you have enough gil. To win this battle, Locke should throw (or attack if he has twin Beam Guns), Edgar should use Drill or Chainsaw, Sabin should use Blitz, and Cyan should use Quadra Slam.  If you are desperate, you can always have Locke throw a Thunderblade at the Crane on the right for mass damage. Do NOT throw it at the crane on the left\! The crane on the left will absorb lightning.

**TIP:** Setzer’s Slots are completely different this time around, and have been “unrigged”. That means you can now properly match icons without the game forcing a certain match upon you. Also, Setzer will do something different depending on how many icons are matched. For example, one ship icon is “Shock Wave”. Two ship icons is “H-Bomb. Three ship icons is “Omega Rays”. If you don’t match any icons at all, the game will pick an attack based on the first icon.  If the first icon is a Chocobo and the other two icons are something else, you will get “Chocobop”. If you match two icons, you will always get the attack of those two icons \- even if the first icon is not a match. There are different attacks for every possible match\!

**Airship (First time):**

**Optional Monster**: Grenade \- If you feel adventurous enough, you may look for Grenade in the forest North of the Veldt (the forest full of of Bombs).  Be warned, Grenade is not as easy as it once was\!  If you manage to beat it, you will also gain a pretty nice rage if Gau is in your party.

**Recruiting Mog:**

* Mog should be recruited right away, since he joins the party at the same level as everyone else now instead of 5 levels higher. There is no need to run through the game at a low level anymore anyway with no Esper bonuses.  
* It should be noted that Mog's dance will never fail anymore\! No more stumbling, in other words.  
* Mog can still use spears, but Boomerangs are now his speciality. Boomerangs are similar to what the Hawkeye once was; they can be thrown at flying monsters for about x2.5 damage.

**TIP:** Most of Mog’s dances have been improved significantly. Some of the more rare dance moves have become much more common, and other useless dance moves have been eliminated. “Love Sonata” has been replaced by “Toxic Tango”, which is very effective against humans. “Desert Aria” will use Sun Bath frequently, and is a good healing dance. Most other dances have a good combination of support and and attack, so feel free to experiment\!

**Water Rondo:**

* This might also be a good time to get Water Rondo and learn all the other dances by visiting the cave at the Veldt, jumping in the river, and following the long path back.

**Item Gathering:**

* There is new gear available at Narshe that you might want before proceeding to the next area.

**Gil Earning:**

* If you need some money to purchase goods and Espers (especially at the auction), I recommend visiting Zozo and fighting and stealing from Harvesters. Harvesters are more common inside the buildings.  Most monsters in Zozo give you a decent amount of Gil.

**Esper Gathering:**

* The usual Espers are available at this point of the game: Seraphim from the thief hiding in the woods of Tzen, as well as Golem and Zoneseek at the Auction.

**NOTE:** Golem and Zoneseek are incredibly usesul against bosses and even regular encounters.  If you find your party getting slaughtered by physical attacks, use Golem. If you find yourself perishing from enemy spells, use Zoneseek to cut enemy magic damage in half.

**Auction House:** 

* You can obtain Zoneseek and Golem at the Auction House, as usual. Once you purchase the espers, the most common item will be an X-Ether. This is a waste of money at this point of the game, but there is a smaller chance of seeing another item here at the auction, and that is the "Holy Bracer". This relic grants regen, cuts Holy damage in half, and also blocks Zombie and Poison. The Auction is the only way to obtain one in the WoB, although there is one in the WoR later in a treasure chest (you can also find these in the auction in the WoR).  
* There is an even smaller chance of seeing a Zephyr cape. The Zephyr cape is great for evading physical attacks 50% of the time.  If you just can't find one, don't worry too much.  Hopefully you already got one at the Magitek facility\!

**NOTE:** The "annoying brat" in the Auction House is still present, but appears far less often. Occasionally you might see the Airship auction \- but it is rare.

**MP Earning:**

**Monster:** Intangir

* The Intangir is still found on the small north-eastern island and is the best for learning spells in the WOB.   
  Be warned that Intangir is not as easy as it used to be, simply because Doom no longer works. That said, it's very possible to beat Intangir with the strongest attacks everyone has.  You will need to start with a spell to remove Intangir's vanish status. Intangir will remain visible for more turns than before, so you have a chance to kill it.   
* He’ll not cast Meteo as often as before, although if your party is at higher levels he will begin casting Meteo more often\!  
* The reward for defeating Intangir is now 20MP\!

**Cave to the Sealed Gate (Recommended Party Level 18-22):**

**LOST FOREVERS Monsters:** Piscodemon, Naga, Coelecite, Zombone, Whisper, Ing \- these monsters can be encountered until the floating continent scene takes place, then they are lost-forever.

**LOST FOREVER ITEMS:** Don't forget the Genji Glove and UltimaWeapon\! The Genji Glove can be obtained after this (although with difficulty), but the UltimaWeapon is lost-forever. You might also want to get the Cat Claw for Sabin \- his best for a while (although not a lost-forever).

* If monsters give you any trouble in this cave, try bringing along Mog and use Earth Blues. This should dish out lots of damage with rock slide.  
* Water Rondo is another good dance if you got it. The two main monsters to watch out for are PiscoDemon (don't let them stay alive too long) and Zombone (they are harder than they used to be).

**Imperial Banquet:**

**LOST-FOREVER MONSTER:** Don't forget to talk to the guys next to Gestahl during the break at the banquet to fight RoyalGuard for their rage at the Vedlt. If you have Locke with you, there is a chance you can steal a Halcyon from them, although you should already have one for Celes at this time...

**LOST FOREVER ITEMS:** I recommend getting a perfect score at the Banquet so you can obtain a rare Tintinabulum and Enhancer. The Tintinabulum can be traded at the Colosseum later for rare items. The Enhancer is the best sword for Celes for a while to come (it’s a big upgrade over the Halcyon). There is also no other way to obtain the Enhancer until Kefka’s tower via a rare steal if you miss it here\! Also make sure to read the next part so you don’t miss Leo’s best sword in the WoB\!

* There are only 23 soldiers to talk to this time around.  The questions at the banquet should be answered the same as in the original game.   
* When you are done with the Banquet itself, there are some new rooms, items, and scenes you don't want to miss in Vector\! When you enter the inside of the palace, check the top of the stairs on the right for two doors. The door on the left is new. It will be blocked by a guard during the banquet, but after the banquet he will be gone. Enter to visit the room of Celes\!  
* You may also get Leo's best sword for a while to come in this room. This is not technically lost-forever since you can get more in the WoR, but it will be less useful by then…  
* Leo is hanging out at the top of the palace if you want to read some new dialog between him and Terra.

**After the Banquet:**

**LOST FOREVER ITEM:** Return to the crashed airship after the banquet. The cutscene between Cid and Setzer has some new dialog, and Cid will ask you to return to Vector for something he wants to give back to Terra. Return to vector as he instructs and go back to the banquet room. Talk to Cid to receive Maduin's Ring. This ring is only equippable on Terra and is basically a Ribbon on steroids.

**NOTE:** If you missed Maduin's Ring and want a complete item list, there IS actually a way to obtain one using Morph at the very end of the WoR. See the Morph section below for more information.

* Don't forget to visit the imperial base to the east before going to Albrook for some easy cash and nice relics. Nothing is really lost-forever, but the items are helpful.  The Wall Ring in particular is useful against the Flame Eater boss coming up, and the Gale Hairpin might come in handy.

**Another NOTE:** This is your last chance to re-visit the Cave to the Sealed Gate if you missed anything there.

**Crescent Island:**

**Monsters:** Baskervor, Cenchos/Goggler, Chimera (in the forest area)

* After speaking to Strago in the house, I recommend purchasing some throwing items for Locke \- especially some Water Edges. They are useful for the burning house segment. The other items are not a bad idea either \- especially the Mage Musket.  
* Don't forget to get the second Memento ring hidden upstairs in Strago's house\! It can be bet for a valuable item at the Colosseum later...

**TIP:**  It’s a decent combo to give Locke a Genji Glove \+ two Mage Muskets (if you can afford it). Unlike other weapons, guns do not lose attack power with the Genji Glove\!

**Burning House (Recommended Party Level 19-23):**

**Monsters:** Balloon

* Blizzard rods and other rods CANNOT be used as an item in battle anymore, but the chance of them casting Ice2 with the fight command still makes them useful against the monsters in the burning house. 

**FlameEater:** A good strategy is to have a wall ring equipped on someone with Terra casting Ice2 (after Flame Eater uses reflect on itself). Zoneseek should be used at the start of the battle for shell on all party members. Locke and Strago could just use potions when healing is needed, or have Locke attack with Mage Musket(s), and Strago fight with a blizzard rod. You can also have Locke throw a Water Edge when lots of monsters are on the screen if you purchased any. If FlameEater calls in a Dark Bomb, you will want to focus on killing it first with Ice2, Blizzard Rod, Locke's throw or Mage Musket, etc..

**After the Burning House:**

**Blue Magic:**  Aqua Rake

* Strago does NOT know Aqua Rake by default. You must learn it from the Chimera in the forest.

**TIP:** Chimera can be a challenge, but with Zoneseek at the start of the battle and some clever healing, they are possible to beat even at lower levels.

**Esper Cave (Recommended Party Level 19-23):**

**Monsters:** Karkinos, Alligator/Eye Fang, Harrier, Ochu \- you have until the WOR to return here if you miss them, then they are gone.

* The Chocobo Suit can be found in the cave as usual, although the Tabby suit no longer exists (in case you thought you missed it).  
* The cave should not be difficult, but if the Karkinos gives any trouble, use Bolt spells against them instead of attacks. Aqua Rake will NOT harm them\!

**Ultros (Again):** This version of Ultros is fairly easy – although you should equip ribbons or Peace Rings to avoid being muddled\!  Just have Terra cast Bolt2/Fire2 (don't forget to Morph her if you can), have Strago attack with a Thunder rod, and have Locke attack with Mage Musket(s). Use Terra for cure when needed.

**Controlling Leo for the first time:**

* You may notice some interesting things about Leo in this game.  
* Leo's Shock ability can only be used once per battle, and will randomly choose between 3 different Shock attacks.   
  * The normal Red Shock attack will pierce the enemy's defense.  
  * The Green Shock will damage the monsters based on Leo's current HP.   
  * The Gold Shock will also pierce defense, but is much more powerful than the Red shock.   
  * There is a 50% chance of the Red Shock, 30% Chance of Green, and 20% chance of Gold.  
* Leo also comes with Miracle, the same ability Banon had. Miracle will randomly choose between Cure1 (20%), Cure2(50%), and Cure3 (30%).   
  Miracle is free to use, but of course is not always reliable in how much it will heal your party.  
* Leo also comes equipped with his own Relic: the Magi Exosuit. Designed by Cid, this relic will grant him dual wield, regen, dash, extra defense, and other status boosts.  It will also heal the entire party with each step.

**NOTE ABOUT RELM:**

* It should be noted that in this game, Relm will now acquire Interceptor. This should make her much more exciting to use\!

**Regaining the Airship again (after Thamasa cutscene):**

**Blue Magic:** Aqua Rake, Vanish, L.3 Muddle, L.4 Flare, L.5 Doom

* Strago can learn a few more Blue Magic spells now:  
  * **Vanish:** The Bandit will sometimes use this in Zozo, or the easier way is to have Gau use the Sahagin or Cygnus rages with Strago in the party.  
  * **NOTE:** Vanish will no longer last beyond the battle you use it in.  
  * **L.3 Muddle**, **L.4 Flare**, **L.5 Doom:** These can be learned from Trapper by attempting to find one in the Veldt.  Gau can also rage one for L.3 Muddle.  
  * You can also wait for the Floating Continent if you don't feel like Veldt hunting; it is much easier there.  
* Make sure to visit Doma Castle (if you did the imperial banquet correctly) to find the Murasame in a treasure chest. The Murasame is quite a significant damage boost for Cyan against a single monster. Although it can’t attack all monsters like Tempest can, it has a 33% chance of criticals and boosts Vigor \+7.  A Gauntlet \+ Murasame should NOT be overlooked\!  It will become an incredibly powerful attack against tougher monsters coming up.   
  It can be found in the WoR if you miss it here for a complete item list, but it is (mostly) useless by that point...  
* If you haven't visited the forest north of the Veldt to find the elusive Grenade yet, now is the time\! The rage is decent at this point as well.  
* I recommend re-visiting the small north-eastern island to fight Itangir in order to have Relm and Celes catch up on magic. Terra should be doing well with magic at this point, but you can bring her as well to learn those last few spells.  
* It might be wise to stock up on plenty of items at Edgar's Castle at this time (with Edgar in your party for a discount of course).

**Checklist Before Floating Continent:**

**LOST-FOREVERS:** Here is a complete list of ALL rages to encounter in the Overworld before progressing to the WOR (they are lost-forever once you beat the Floating Continent):

* Grenade (forest northwest of Veldt, rare encounter)  
* Lesser Wolf, Dark Wind, Sand Ray, Areneid (outside Narshe)  
* Mu, Goblin, Gigantoad (Outside South Figaro)  
* Red Wolf, Knocker, Rhinotaur, Funguar (outside the Returners hideout or outside Nikeah)  
* Sprinter, Stray Cat, CrassHoppa (Sabin's Scenario area north of Veldt)  
* Ogre, Warg, Sahagin, Trilium/Mandrake (Outside Kohlingen, Jidoor, Zozo)  
* Water Hag, Dingo, Wyvern, Vulture, ChickenLip, FossilFang, Vespula (Outside Vector, Albrook, Maranda, Tzen)  
* Intangir (island in far northeast of overworld)  
* Baskervor, Chimera, Goggler/Cenchos (outside Thamasa)

**Imperial Airforce (IAF) sequence: (Recommended Party Level 20-23):**

**Monsters:** Skycopter, Spitfire

* Skycopter is now the enemy to watch out for that can use Absolute 0 on you.  
* Airforce will drop an Atomic Rod \- a nice weapon to have for the Floating continent for Strago.  
* You can also steal a Debilitator from MissileBay, although it’s not a lost-forever by any means.

**Airforce:** I would recommend using Zoneseek for the Airforce battle. Have Leo attack Speck anytime one appears, and have Celes cast Bolt2 against Airforce. Strago might be useful with a healing rod for this fight, since Speck will only absorb curative spells and not his attacks. Strago can also use Aqua Rake for mass damage against all these machines.

**Floating Continent (Recommended Party Level 21-24):**

**Monsters:** Gigantos (from the treasure orb), Minotaur/Necrotaur, Behemoth, Dragon, Apokryphos, Ninja, Wyrm, Brainpan, Float Eye \- these monsters are all lost-forever once you beat the floating continent.

**NOTE:** The Behemoth rage no longer grants Meteor, but Flash Rain instead. This is the most powerful spell anyone can perform at this point of the game. Gigantos is another nice rage that has a more powerful physical special attack than Stray Cat, thus putting that poor little cat up for retirement...

**Blue Magic:** Blow Fish, Revenge, L.3 Muddle, L.4 Flare, L.5 Doom

* **L.3 Muddle** and **L.4 Flare** can be learned from Apokryphos if you didn't already pick it up.  
* **L.5 Doom** can be learned from Float Eye  
* **Blow Fish** can be learned from Brainpan  
* **Revenge** can be learned from Dragon or Gigantos (more difficult)

There are quite a few nice rare steals. In particular, I recommend stealing Knuckles from Minotaur/Necrotaur (a new weapon for Gau), since you cannot obtain another one until the WoR. The Genji Glove is nice to steal from the Dragon, but isn't totally necessary since Leo already has Dual wield with the Magi Exosuit, and you should already have a Genji Glove from the Cave to the Sealed Gate.

Here is a full list of rare steals in the Floating Continent:

* Minotaur/Necrotaur \- Knuckles  
* Dragon \- Genji Glove  
* Apokryphos: Sniper Sight  
* Behemoth: Hermes Shoes  
* Wyrm: DragoonBoots  
* Ninja \- Prayer Beads  
* Brainpan \- Magic Armlet

**TIP:** Gigantos can be a real challenge if Strago has not learned Vanish. One strategy is to use Golem right away to gain a few turns before Golem's protection is over. During this time, I recommend casting Break to petrify Gigantos (it might take a few tries, since he can block your magic). Another option is to use Bio and poison based spells repeatedly (use Venom Claws if you have Sabin).

**Treasures:**

* It should be noted that both treasures have been changed in version 2.0 of ASC.  You will now obtain a “Medusa Bow” and “Beast Slayer”.   
* Medusa Bow is the best weapon for Terra at this point.  It may look uninteresting initially, but it has a random “dread” special, which will turn monsters to stone. Very few monsters in the Floating Continent are immune to stone, so this can be very useful\!  
* The “Beast Slayer is a new sword for ASC 2.0 that will deal more damage against large beasts, dragons, dinosaurs, and more.  Basically, any large monster with a lot of HP. Examples include Behemoths, Dragons, and the upcoming Ultima Weapon boss.

**Ultima Weapon (ATMA) (Recommended Party Level 23-27):**

* Before fighting Ultima weapon, it might be wise to get better rages for Gau if you plan to use him here. Behemoth, Gigantos, Dragon, Ninja, and Minotaur/Necrotaur are all good rages.  
* I recommend casting float on everyone prior to this battle in case Ultima Weapon uses Quake. I would also use either Golem or Zoneseek to offer both physical and magical protection.  
* A Ribbon would be wise on your best healer so they are not affected by MindBlast. You can also use Maduin'sRing on Terra in place of a Ribbon.  
* The Beast Slayer should definitely be given to Leo since it will deal x2 damage against Ultima Weapon. In fact, if you really want to deal maximum damage, consider giving Leo a Gauntlet with the Beast Slayer. This will end up causing more damage than dual wield with Hyperion \+ Beast Slayer.

**Ultima Weapon:** This will be the hardest boss you have fought so far. 

* Have Celes use Runic as often as you can (when she is not healing the party) to block most of Ultima's attacks.  Note that this will not stop Flare, Meteo, or Flare Star, but it will block All the fire-based spells. If you have a stockpile of X-Potions, now is the time to use them\!   
* Any time a party member dies, I would have two party members use Phoenix Downs/X-potions in rapid succession to bring them back and heal them full.   
* If you are on a low level and the battle proves to be difficult, bring as many spell-casters as you can (Terra, Celes, and Relm) to constantly heal while one or two party members focus on attacking the whole time.  
* Leo can cause a decent amount of damage with the Beast Slayer, or he can use Miracle if you are in desperate need of healing and your mages are all busy.

**Escaping the Floating Continent:**

**Monsters:** Naude \- which can now be encountered on the Veldt\!

**Blue Magic:** Condemned

* Condemned can only be learned from Nerapa if you decided to bring Strago.

**TIP:** For the Nerapa fight, you can cripple him with Berserk or Muddle. Doom can also work (if it is successful). Otherwise, Nerapa is weak to Ice, Bolt, and Holy.

**NOTE:** Shadow is not a playable character anymore, so your party will jump to the airship automatically without a prompt to wait for him.

## World of Ruin

**The lonely island and Cid:**

**Monsters:** Leaf Bunny, Tumbleweed

**SPOILER:** Saving Cid will later allow him to join you on the Falcon, where he will heal your party for free. You will also obtain a megalixir later on if you re-visit him with the airship. Is this worth missing the nice cutscene with Celes?  The choice is yours…

**Arriving near Albrook:**

**Monsters:** Mesosaur, Gilomantis, Lizard, Phantom (forest), Antlion (desert), Sand Worm (rare in the desert)

* Immediately After the ocean raft ride, I recommend visiting Albrook \- if not to at least stock up on items (and to read some nice new dialog in-town). Smoke Bombs might be nice for Celes for her short journey to find Sabin, since most monsters in this area are considerably dangerous with no loyal team support.  
* If you absolutely insist on fighting a few monsters with Celes by herself, I recommend giving her the Golem or Phantom esper to use at the start of each battle as well as a ribbon and Jewel ring to protect her from stone and confusion. This will give her a fighting chance. If she has the Enhancer sword, this can kill many monsters in one hit as long as she has MP to spare for those critical hits. You can even consider giving her a Gauntlet to increase the power of the Enhancer.

**Tzen and the Collapsing House:**

**Monsters:** Zenene, Phantom \- Zenene is lost-forever if you somehow miss it, but that should be nearly impossible.  Phantom can be encountered in the forests outside at any time.

* Remember to equip a jewel ring before entering the collapsing house\! Monsters in there will turn you into stone if you don’t.  
* The treasures inside the collapsing house contain no lost-forevers, but there is a nice Atomic Rod in one chest, although it's not critical.  
* You can purchase a Circlet or two at the armor shop here.

**Journey to Nikeah (and optional trip to Mobliz):**

**Monsters:** Buffalax, Bloompire

* The first thing you should notice about Sabin is a new blitz he has if above level 23\. His new blitz is a single target, poison-based attack called “Cobra Rush”. This will allow you to take on Phunbaba if you feel confident.  
* If you decide to take on Phunbaba, you can travel to Mobliz. The key to winning this battle is to have Sabin use his new “Cobra Rush” blitz. Meanwhile, Celes should use Runic and/or Cure when needed. Alternatively, you can give Sabin one or two Venom Claws. A Wall Ring is another choice to block Phunbabas magic. If Celes gets any free turns, have her cast Bio.  
* Nikeah has the Diamond gear, which is a good purchase if you have the Gil for it. South Figaro has it as well.  
* The monsters on the way to Nikeah (and Mobliz) can be tough with just Celes and Sabin.  I recommend using Golem at the start of each battle if you struggle to win.  
  Most monsters are weak to either Fire or Ice. Phantom can cast some nasty spells if left alive for too long. Phantom is immune to all the elements as well as poison. Take them down with Sabin's blitz and/or regular fighting with a non-elemental claw/sword (Enhancer works well).

**South Figaro and Gerad:**

**Monsters:** Coeurl, Crawler, Garuda (forest), Antlion (desert), Sand Worm (desert), DragonBone/BlackFang (rare, desert)

* There is plenty of new dialog in South Figaro. I especially recommend talking to everyone in the cafe\!  
* Monsters outside South Figaro are once again tough with just Sabin and Celes, but you can probably manage to defeat some of them with the Golem Esper. If you dare to visit the desert here, expect to be slaughtered by Sand Worms. You likely won't be able to win until you at least have a fully party. You also have about a 1/24 chance of encountering a DragonBone, which is even worse than Sand Worms. The DragonBone has a chance to drop a Bone Mallet – a weapon you can later bet at the Colosseum.

**Figaro Cave:**

**Monsters:** Humpty, Leech bat, Gigas Worm

* If you skipped the treasures here in the world of balance, now is the time to get them.

**Figaro Castle and the Engine room:**

**Monsters:** Cruller, Pipsqueak, Velamyu

* You may re-visit this area at any time to get treasures or fight any monsters you missed. Dropper is no longer a monster encounter you need to look for.

**Tentacles:** The strategy against the tentacles is only slightly different from the original game. Equipping Hermes shoes will stop the tentacles from slowing your party down, but it will NOT stop the tentacles from seizing a party member\! I recommend summoning Golem at the start of the battle to block the "Seize" move. Use something like Bio Blaster to poison the tentacles and chip away at their health while Celes heals the party. This battle is only difficult if you let the tentacles slow you down and sap your engergy\!

**Back to Kohlingen:**

**Monsters:** Zu, Delta Bug, Hill Gigas, Chupon (in the forest)

* Outside of Kohlingen in the forest, you will encounter Chupon. There is a slim chance you will beat him at this point of the game, but you can try. The main purpose of defeating Chupon is for Gau to obtain the rage.  He also drops Elixirs every time, which isn’t too shabby either. The best method to beat Chupon is to cast Bersrk (this will stop his sneeze), but be warned, he will dish out mass amounts of damage by attacking. You will either need to use Fenrir for image protection or Vanish once you obtain Strago (or Gau with Cygnus or Sahagin rage). Chupon has 50,305 HP, so causing as much damage as possible per turn will be necessary.

**Colosseum:**

* There is not a lot you can do at this point, but you can attempt to bet a Blood Sword for a Soul Staff (recovers MP). The MindFlayer is very difficult, but you just might win with some DragoonBoots equipped. The Soul Staff is a nice way to recover MP without wasting too many Ethers if you are low on gil.  
* You can also bet one of your Tintinabulums for a Charm Bangle, and a Charm Bangle for Marvel Shoes \- although the monsters you will face are tough.  If you successfully beat both the Allosaurus and Samurai/Yokai, you will obtain the Marvel Shoes.

SPOILER: You can also attempt to bet one of the two Memento Rings to win Shadow's Armor, the “Shadow-Yoroi”. This armor grants protection against instant death, but unlike the Memento Ring, can be equipped by multiple characters. It is a great piece of armor at this point of the game. There is also a secret attritube of this armor: if you equip it on Setzer, his GilToss will change to Throw\!

**Daryl's Tomb (Recommended Party Level 24-29):**

**Monsters:** Orog, Powerdemon, Exoray, Malboro, DeathRider.

* You will want to equip an Amulet or the superior Holy Bracer on all characters to prevent zombie. Most monsters here are weak to Fire and Holy (Aura Bolt with Sabin is useful).

**Archdaemon (Monster-in-a-box):** The treasure chest previously containing "Presenter" now has a new mini-boss called Archdaemon. The trick here is to use Golem or Fenrir at the start of the battle, and cure party members as they get low on HP. When Archdaemon is low on HP, he will use Cyclonic followed by an attack on each party member in an attempt to bring them down. If you used Golem or Fenrir, the attacks should be blocked. He will keep repeating this move until dead, so take him out fast once he is low on HP.

**ITEM GAINED:** Dancing Claw (equip this on Sabin right away).

**Tomb Guard:** This is a new boss in Daryl's Tomb (replaces Dullahan). It has a lot of HP, so be prepared. Zoneseek is good to summon at the start of the battle. North Cross is the biggest threat to look out for here. I would have Edgar use Chainsaw, Sabin use Aura Bolt, and Setzer attack with his guns and/or GilToss while Celes cures and/or uses Runic to stop the regular Ice2/Ice3 spells.

If Celes manages to get a free turn, have her use Fire2.  Each time you attack Tomb Guard, it has a chance to counter with a moderate sword strike twice. For this reason, you should make sure you do reasonable damage against Tomb Guard each time you attack.

**FALCON OBTAINED:**

This is that part of the game where you can take dozens of different paths, but I will list them in a manner that allows you to obtain all treasures and lost-forevers without jumping all over the place leaving half-finished dungeons here and there (which I personally hate doing). Of course, nothing is stopping you from attempting to get the Moogle charm and raid all the treasures, but in this hack you will not be racing straight to Kefka and expect to win. The point of this portion is to prepare yourself for the fight against Kefka, right?  The order of things below is simply the cleanest way to do that, in my opinion. Besides, you wouldn't want to run through the dungeons with a Moogle Charm and miss all the new monsters in the hack, would you?

**Gil Earning:**

If you need Gil at any point, you can visit Mt. Zozo and fight just about any monster there, but the absolute best way is to encounter GoldGiants outside Thamasa. They will prove to be difficult early on, however. You will need to be on a higher level or at least have some better equipment before you rush off to fight them.

**NOTE:** The monsters in the desert outside Maranda no longer grant much Gil. These monsters are strictly for earning magic points\!

**Item Purchasing:**

* Thamasa has some important armor, such as the Tao robe, Dark Gear, Oath Veil, and Dark Hood. Also in the weapon shop is a Gaia Wand and White Bow. The Gaia Wand will sometimes cast Magnitude8, which is not a bad choice. White Bow is the best weapon for Terra for a while. It grants a 25% magic boost and is Holy Elemental. This bow will deal mass damage to anything undead, which is actually quite a few monsters throughout various dungeons in the WOR. The bow is also great for Mog. Celes might still be better off with the Enhancer since she would otherwise lose Runic.   
* The item store at Thamasa has Hi-Ethers \- the only place to purchase these. Finally, you can purchase all throwing weapons here, including the Ninja Star. The Ninja star costs a lot to purchase, but is worth buying in bulk later when you have lots of Gil and nothing to do with it.  
* Jidoor has all the Crystal gear, which is good for Cyan, Setzer, Leo and Edgar until better equipment is obtained/found throughout each dungeon in the WOR. The Rainbowbrush in Jidoor is also the best for Relm for a while.  
* As in the WOB, any basic items you need should be purchased in Figaro Castle with Edgar for a discount\!

**Monster hunting and leveling up:**

* If at any point you need to gain levels, the following is a list of monsters in various locations you may visit in the overworld. I have listed them in order of difficulty (from easiest to hardest):  
* Outside Kohlingen: You have already fought these monsters, but you may return here if other areas prove to be too difficult.  The Sand Worms in the desert area will give you a decent amount of Experience and Gil.  
* Outside Jidoor/Zozo: Reach Frog, Basilisk, Tortoise \- These monsters are not as bad as other WOR locations, but they can still catch you off guard if you aren't prepared. Make sure to wear Jewel Rings, or the Basilisk will turn you to stone very quickly.  
* Outside Narshe: Baretta, Centipede \- These monsters are good for leveling up halfway through the WOR. They can cause some decent damage on you, but aren't overly difficult.  
* Outside Thamasa: Colossus, Teratorn, GoldGiant \- these monsters are definitely a step up in difficulty than the monsters outside Jidoor or Narshe, but they do give some decent experience (except for Goldgiant, which is for Gil only). This area is good to visit when you aren't strong enough for the next location but the other monsters have become too easy.  
* Grass areas outside Dinosaur Forest: King Gigas, Giant Liz, T-Rexaur, Hellhound \- The Monsters in the grassy areas outside the Dinosaur forest are very powerful physically speaking, but not quite as hard as the dinosaurs inside the forest itself. This would be a good area to level up in before entering the Phoenix Cave, or possibly even Kefka's Tower. I would recommend using Fenrir or vanish when facing these monsters. They have a lot of HP, so be ready\!  
* Dirt/Dead patches outside Dinosaur Forest: White Croc/Great Croc, T-Rexaur, Giant Liz \- The White Croc/Great Croc is probably the hardest monster that appears outside the Dinosaur forest (it will also rarely appear inside the forest, too).  It will sometimes use Flood (or El Nino and Tsunami at higher levels), which can be deadly.  These are also good monsters to level up on around the time you want to enter Kefka's tower or even face Kefka himself.  
* Dinosaur Forest:  Tyranosaur, Brachosaur, T-Rexaur, White Croc \- These are the hardest monsters in the overworld of the WOR, and should be the last monsters you choose to level up on.   
  Besides Kefka's Tower, this is the best place to get yourself to level 99 if you wish to do so (there is only one small reason to do this, explained in the final Kefka section).

**SPOILER:** There is a 1/64 chance of encountering a monster in the dino-forest called the Haniwa (more rare than the Brachosaur). You may read more about it in the "Beast Hunting" section.  
**SPOILER \#2:** Once you are above Lvl 50, the normal Tyranosaur will start fleeing, and a Tyranosaur with a different appearance will come in. These versions are tougher, but will also grant more Exp\!

**The Rift Island:**

After a bit of exploring with the Falcon, you may notice a brand new island that is not mapped out on the minimap. The island is at the southwest (bottom left) corner of the map. This land has several purposes, with the main purpose being something discussed below in the “Elusive Beast Hunting” section. The Rift island is home to many monsters that could be easily missed in the World of Balance. If Gau is missing that one rage that you never encountered, chances are pretty good it will be on this island.  Here is a full list of monsters you may encounter here:

* Dirt/Dead patches, northeast portion:  RocketMech, Cygnus, Vector Pup, Grunt, Mega Amor, ProtoArmor, Sentry, Samurai, Joker, M-TekEagle, IO, Allurer, Wart Puck  
* Dirt/Dead patches, northwest portion: Telstar, Soldier, Red Roader, Mag Roader, Trapper, General, Sentry, EliteTroop, HeavyArmor, Trooper, ScoutArmor, Rottweiler  
* Dirt/Dead patches, southeast portion: RoyalGuard, Behemoth, Brainpain, Apokryphos, Ninja, Whisper, Piscodemon, Naga, Zombone, Coelecite, Ing  
* Dirt/Dead patches, southwest portion:  Bleary, Hornet, LesserWolf, Dark Wind, Gold Bear, Primordite, HermitCrab, Cirpius, Funguar, Cave Ape, Tusker  
* Forest: Hobgoblin, Vaporite, Warlock, Lamentor, Chickenlip, Skeleton, Bomb, Shadow, Keeper, Wight  
* Desert: Intangir, Dragon, Behemoth, Grenade, Chimera, Goggler/Cenchos, Minotaur/Necrotaur, Float Eye, Apokryphos, Ninja, Wyrm  
* Grass: Gigantos, Ochu, Harrier, Rhinotaur, Gigantoad, Goblin, Mu, Red Wolf, Knocker, Karkinos, Alligator/Eye Fang 

**Earning MP for spells:**

The desert south of Maranda is the best place To gain MP for learning spells. The Slagworm can be defeated by casting Doom (although it might take a few tries).   
The Cactuar can be defeated with the sniper sight as well as Drill, most blitz attacks, Dispatch, or Blowfish, among other spells.

**NOTE:** The Cactuar has a 1/8 chance of dropping a Chef Skewer \- the Pug weapon.

**SPOILER:** There is a 1/32 chance of encountering the elusive Gigantuar. I listed more about this in the "Beast Hunting" section of the Guide.  The Gigantuar will be nearly impossible to beat until you have gained most of the equipment throughout the WOR and gained a few levels.

**Recruiting Terra and fighting Phunbaba:**

Now is a perfect time to fight Phunbaba and recruit Terra.

**Phunbaba:** This should be manageable with a full party. That said, this fight is in fact tougher than the original game. I would start the battle with zoneseek and/or shell on each character, and have Setzer use guns and/or GilToss, Sabin use blitz (especially Cobra Rush), Edgar use Chainsaw/Drill, and Celes and Terra use Bio. When someone is low on HP, have Terra or Celes use Cure on them. Phunbaba has a lot of HP, so this fight will last a little while.

**Recruiting Leo:**

When Phunbaba is killed, he will drop the "Sun Blade". This can be bet at the colosseum to recruit General Leo.

**NOTE:** The Sun Blade is a very nice weapon for Leo that will randomly cast Flame on all monsters.  It will be Leo's best weapon for a little while, and should replace either the Beast Slayer or Hyperion.

**Recruiting Gau:**

Now that you can go inside the airship and reduce your party to 3 members, visit the Veldt and recruit Gau.

**SPOILER:** Now that you have Gau back, take the Falcon to the house of Gau's father. This time around, you will gain a weapon for Gau \- the "Wild Heart". This weapon not only makes Gau more powerful, but also makes him immune to instant death spells.

**Visiting the lonely island:**

* If you saved Cid, now is a good time to re-visit him with Celes to enable some new dialog and obtain a megalixir. Cid will now also join you on the airship.  
* Don't forget to visit the beach to obtain the Palidor Esper. 

**SPOILER:** As of version 2.0, Cid will join you on the airship if you saved him and talk to him with Celes in the party. He will then heal your party any time you talk to him on the airship.

**Mount Zozo (Recommended Party Level 25-30):**

**Monsters:** Virago, Nomad, NeckHunter, Scrapper, HadesGigas

Mt. Zozo is not actually that hard. Most opponents are weak to Bio/Poison. The treasures are all very nice and prepare you for other dungeons, which is why I recommend this be your first major stop. Sabin is a great character to have here for his “Cobra Rush” blitz. It will poison all the humans here as well as deal mass damage since they are weak to poison.

**TIP:** HadesGigas can pack quite a punch, so be wary. Shield, Golem, or Fenrir is advised.  You can steal a rare Muscle Belt from HadesGigas, although you likely won't have Locke yet.

**Storm Dragon:**  You might have to return here later when your party is at higher levels. However, you can attempt to win by equipping Terra or Celes with a thunder shield and having them rapidly bring back deceased party members. Use Zoneseek to reduce the damage caused by its magic attacks, and use your most powerful attacks.

**ITEM GAINED:** Aegis Shield

**Opera house and the Earth Dragon:** 

This is about a good time to face the Earth Dragon. Purchase 4 cherub downs, equip all party members with one, and use Fenrir at the start of the battle to help block the regular attacks.  It shouldn't be too hard to win after this point…

**ITEM GAINED:** Safety Bit

**Cave in the Veldt (Recommended Party Level 26-32):**

**Monsters:** Iguion, Blood Horn, Aps

* A monster named "Aps" (No more Rhyos) will sometimes make an appearance here, and you can't run from him \- so be well prepared\!  
* Once you get Locke or Gogo, you may steal a rare Bone Mallet from Aps, which can be bet at the Colosseum for many other great items.

**King Beast:** This battle is quite a bit tougher than the original. At low levels, I recommend using Fenrir on everyone to gain image, and keep casting image as needed on those who lose the status. Zoneseek is also beneficial. In fact, I recommend bringing both Terra and Celes to use both espers in the battle.  Keep healing and casting Fire based spells. Have Terra Morph for mass damage with Fire2 or Fire3 if you have it yet. Leo is not a bad choice for attacking, since King Beast is weak to the Beast Slayer and the special attack of the Sun Blade. Equip them both for lots of damage.

**ITEM GAINED:** The usual BehemothSuit is dropped here.  Relm can no longer eqiup the BehemothSuit, but it is the best armor for Strago (at least for a long time). You can still trade the BehemothSuit at the Colosseum for a Snow Muffler, but that is only if you want Mog or Gau to have their best armor while denying Strago his.

**NOTE:** The KingBeast does not appear on the Veldt (unlike the original game). There are in fact other ways to obtain more than one BehemothSuit, however (see further down the guide).

**Narshe and Mog:**

**Monsters (outside areas):** Dante, Amarok, Troll (outside areas), Life Eater, Brain Bug (inside areas), Mindflayer, Frost (snowy Fields)

Dante shares some similarities to Intangir, except it will only use vanish when low on HP. Like Intangir, it will give you some nice MP, but this time it will give you Gil and Exp as well.

**TIP:** You cannot run from a particular monster called a "Life Eater" in the caves leading up to Mog, so be prepared. They aren't overly difficult unless you are underleveled.

**TIP \#2:** When you recruit Mog, don’t forget the Moogle Charm behind where he is standing.  Also, be sure to learn the Snowman Jazz in the Narshe snow fields. Unlike the original game, it is actually quite powerful and includes a new move called “Hailstorm” – a defense piercing, group ice attack. Ice Rabbit also heals the party fairly well at this point.

**Narshe and Tritoch:**

MindFlayers found on the way to Tritoch will regularly use instant death attacks.  I recommend bringing Gau equipped with the Wild Heart, Relm equipped with a Memento Ring (If you have her yet), and anyone else equipped with a Safety Bit (dropped by the Earth Dragon) \- all of which block fatal attacks.

**SPOILER:** If you won the Shadow-Yoroi armor at the Colosseum, give this to another character (possibly Setzer), which also blocks instant death attacks.  If not, now might be a good time to return to the Colosseum and bet a Memento Ring.

**Tritoch:** This is pretty easy by equipping a flame shield on Terra (found at Mt. Zozo). Have Terra Morph and cast Fire2/Fire3 repeatedly. Tritoch can't do much with the Fire immunity.

**Narshe and the Ice Dragon:**

The Ice Dragon is possible to defeat at lower levels if you give the Ice Shield to either Terra or Celes (I recommend Terra). Use Image on Terra/Celes, and have them cast Fire2/Fire3 repeatedly. The Ice Dragon cannot harm you as long as you keep using Image as necessary, and slowly chip away at its health. Don't bother bringing other party members back to life if they keep dying, and instead focus on keeping Terra or Celes alive.

**ITEM GAINED:** Force Shield

**Narshe and Umaro's Cave (Recommended Party Level 27-33):**

**Monsters:** Cerberus, Mad Ogre, Hecteyes, Tonberry (rare), Mimic, Brain Bug

**Blue Magic:** Step Mine, Tsunami

* **Tsunami** can be learned by Mimic if you use a Water Edge on it (1/3 chance he will counter with Tsunami).  
* **Step Mine** can be easily leanrned from Tonberry, at least if you can manage to kill one\!  Gau can also learn the rage and use it with Strago in the party for Step Mine.

\-Tonberry has a rare drop/steal of a Tintinabulum, which can be traded at the Colosseum for a CharmBangle followed by MarvelShoes. The Tonberry has a common "Pug Cloak" drop and a common "Lantern" steal, which is the Pug shield.   
\-Mad Ogre has a rare Bone Mallet steal, which can be bet at the Colosseum for many other great items.

**NOTE:** The Moogle Disk/Gaia Disk obtained in the treasure chest will appear at the very bottom of the weapon list with an attack power of "1". This may make the weapon look useless, but it actually completely ignores the defense of monsters. It will become very powerful as you progress through the WoR and Kefka's Tower when monsters have very high physical defense. The Disk will also never miss, and will randomly attack with "Whump".  Mog might be better off as a Dragoon at first, but later on you should remember this weapon\!

**Tonberries (monster-in-a-box):** The Tonberries are mostly unchanged from the original. Cast Image or Vanish on your party members (consider Fenrir) when the Tonberries are close to your party.  Use Bio on them to inflict poison, and cast Fire-based spells or use defense piercing moves that are more accurate, like Edgar's Drill, Sabin's Pummel, or Cyan's Dispatch.

**NOTE:** The tonberries no longer grant Minerva gear, so there is no need to torture yourself attempting to get 3 drops or steals; instead, they drop a common Pug Crown and rarely MarvelShoes (which can be obtained through easier means outside this battle). If by some off chance you don't get the Pug Crown, you can also obtain them from T-Rexaur in and near the Dinosaur forest, or by morphing several monsters (see the morph section).

**Sasquatch:** The battle against Umaro, \*ahem\*, I mean Sasquatch is only a tad bit harder than before. His HP is a little higher, his physical attacks deal more damage, and some of his regular moves are more powerful. That being said, the usual strategy should work. Attack Sasquatch with Bio to poison him, and use Fire2/Fire3. You can also slow him down if you want. The rest should be straight-forward.

**Umaro Recruited:**

* It should definitely be noted that Umaro is now fully functional and can be controlled. You can also equip him\!  
* Umaro has a new ability called Gaia. This ability randomly calls all sorts of animals for help along with natural attacks.  Here is a full list of all the possible moves/attacks:

  * Toxic Frog  
  * Whump  
  * Rock Slide  
  * Hailstorm  
  * Wild Bear  
  * Chocobop  
  * Harvester  
  * Stone  
  * Avalanche  
  * Magnitude8  
  * Ice Storm  
  * Ice Rabbit  
  * Kitty  
  * Cocatrice  
  * Rage  
  * North Cro

**Owzer's Mansion (Recommended Party Level 27-33):**

**Monsters:** DoomKnight, Mummy, pumpkin, Burnt Flan

**TIP:** Still Life is a bit harder this time around. I recommend having one or two characters with instant death protection (Wild Heart, Memento ring, Shadow-Yoroi, Safety-Bit, etc.) Otherwise, use Fire based spells to take it out fast before condemned has a chance to work. Terra and Morph with Fire2/Fire3 is a good idea.

**NOTE:** Still Life no longer appears on the veldt.

**Chadarnook:** This is pretty much unchanged from the original game, and the battle isn't hard at all. Just avoid attacking the pretty lady, and instead attack the Demon.  Use Fire or Holy based spells.

**Strago and new Blue Magic to obtain:**

Now that you have Relm, Strago can be recruited in the normal way: by taking Relm to the Fanatic's Tower. There is a lot of new Blue magic he can learn.

* **Aero:** Learned from Zu back outside of Kohlingen  
* **White Wind:** Learned from Leaf Bunny on the lonely island you started at  
* **Big Guard:** Can be learned if you Sketch/Control or Rage Leaf Bunny  
* **Dischord:** The easiest way is to learn it from Crawler outside South Figaro  
* **Rippler:** This can also be learned from Crawler outside South Figaro  
* **Dark:** This can be learned from PowerDemon back in Daryl's Tomb. Death Rider will also use it if you are above lvl 30\.  Dark is basically a slightly weaker version of Flare that is poison elemental.  It is NOT useful against undead monsters, but is great against anything else (especially monsters in the overworld map).  
* **Sour Mouth:** Can be learned from Malboro in Daryl's Tomb

**Doom Gaze:**  This is about a good time to find Doom Gaze. Make sure anyone you bring is not on a level divisible by 5, or equip something to block fatal magic for L.5 Doom. If you have a character with Throw, I recommend purchasing a handful of Flame Sabres from Albrook, Nikeah, or South Figaro, and toss them at Doom Gaze. This can easily dish out 4,000-5,000 damage. Also bring Terra, have her Morph and cast Fire2/Fire3. Doom Gaze can be defeated fairly quickly with these tactics\!

**Ebot's Rock (Recommended Party Level 28-34):**

**Monsters:** Medusa, Osteosaur, Flood Naga, Vampiress, Ghast, Abyss Worm, BlackWaltz/Red Waltz

**Blue Magic:** Tsunami, GrandTrain

Flood Naga will use Tsunami on about the 4th turn as a 2/3 chance.

* It should be noted that you only have to get 22 pieces of coral total to proceed past the treasure chest. If you get more than 22 it doesn’t matter unlike the original game.

**Hidon:** This is easier to beat if you use ZoneSeeker, PodBracelets, MarvelShoes, or Shell to cut down the damage caused by GrandTrain. Also equip MuscleBelts and Red Caps to beef up the HP of your party members.  If anyone has DragoonBoots, have them jump right after the last hidonite is killed so they dodge GrandTrain. Once you learn GrandTrain, you can always have Edgar use a Chainsaw for a potential instant-kill on Hidon.  Otherwise, you can just use Holy, Fire, etc.

**NOTE:** There is a rare Skull Helmet steal with Hidon, but there are much easier ways to obtain it as mentioned later in this Guide.

**Zone Eater's Belly (Recommended Party Level 30-35):**

**Monsters:** Ging-Ryu, Kamui, Assassin, WhiteDrake/Sun Drake, Ahriman

**Blue Magic:** Step Mine, L.2 Holy, Condemned

* **L.2 holy** can be learned from both White Drake/Sun Drake and Ging-Ryu. L.2 Holy replaces the useless "L? Pearl" in the original game. It now targets monsters with a level divisible by 2, which is a lot of them.  It is slightly more powerful than the normal Holy spell, and costs less MP.  
* **Step Mine** can be learned from Ging-Ryu if you are willing to wait for it (he has a 1/3 chance of using it after about 7 turns).  
* **Condemned** is used by Ahriman if you haven't already learned it.

**NOTE:** The Fury Ring in the treasure chest (previously Rage Ring) beefs up Umaro more than in the original. It allows him to counter attacks, gives him a 25% attack power boost, and grants the usual toss ability.

**NOTE \#2:** The Fake Mustache is no longer a relic as of version 2.0.  Instead, you get a Hypno Crown, which will grant Relm control all the same. It is also her best helmet for MP boosting (although there is another good helmet for Relm for HP boosting and speed).

**Defender (monster-in-a-box):** This is an optional new mini-boss that, as the name implies, has a lot of defense. To win this battle, start off with Fenrir, and rapidly cast image on characters as they lose it. Don't bother with physical attacks, but instead use your best defense piercing moves and magic. Examples are Chainsaw/Drill, Pummel/Suplex/Bum Rush, UltimaWeapon, Quadra Slice if Cyan has it yet, etc.. If you have Relm in your party, Sketch the Defender for a good chance of using Step Mine. If Strago is in your party, it's also a way for him to learn step mine if he hasn't already.  If Strago already knows Step Mine, have him use it\!

**ITEM GAINED:** Defeating the Defender boss will grant you the Defender sword. The main benefit of the Defender sword is the incredible evade boost it grants on top of defending other weak party members. It's a great sword for Leo and is more powerful than the Sun Blade, although it lacks a special. It can also be equipped on many other characters\!

**Recruiting Gogo, Stealing:**

Once you get Gogo, many good items can be stolen/dropped by various monsters in Zone Eater's Belly (give Gogo a sneak ring to make things easier):

* WhiteDrake/Sun Drake \- rare Drake Suit steal (Relm's best armor\!)  
* Kamui \- rare Murasame Steal (makes a nice second weapon for Cyan with a Genji Glove if he doesn’t already have a better sword).  
* Assassin \- rare Mirage Vest Steal (best armor for a few characters, at least for a while).  
* Ging-Ryu \- rare Dancing Claw steal (trade this at the Colosseum for the 2nd best spear).

**SPOILER:** Gogo has his own line of weapons this time around. Which is futuristic guns. He is from a different dimension, after all... His PhaseBlaster has a chance to attack with his new desperate move: Twin Sword. Basically, the idea here is that Gogo can sometimes holster his gun and use those dual swords you see on his back. Obviously if you give Gogo a weapon other than a gun that he cannot holster, he won’t use Twin sword.

**Miscellaneous overworld steals:**  

* Now that you have Gogo, there are a few items to be mentioned that you can steal from various monsters in the overworld:  
* Outside Thamasa, you can steal a rare Gold Fist from a GoldGiant. The Gold Fist is the best weapon for Gau for now and boosts all magic-based rages, although there is a better fist later on for attack-based rages.  
* You can steal a rare Ribbon from T-Rexaur in and near the dinosaur forest.

**Bum Rush (Minor spoiler):**  
Now is a good time to learn Bum Rush.  I didn't put this earlier in the guide, because this time around there is a new boss fight: Vargas\! He can be a bit tricky at lower levels before you have obtained some of the equipment you should now have. I found the best way to win is to cast Fenrir/Image on all party members, and simply bring people back to life as quickly as possible when he throws Kunai Darts or Asura swords.  

If you have a few muscle belts, give those to party members for a better chance of surviving the mass damaged caused by his throwing weapons.  Finally, I would equip Safety Bits, Wild Heart, Memento ring, Shadow-Yoroi, etc. to protect party members from Doom Fist.  Either that, or kill Vargas as fast as possible with your most powerful attacks to win before your characters start dying.

Once you have won the battle, you will learn Bum Rush and also obtain the Godhand, Sabin's best weapon (although there is another weapon just as good mentioned in the Kefka's Tower section).

**NOTE:** Vargas has a rare Skull Helmet steal and a common Dancing Claw steal, but both of these items can be obtained easily later on.  They are not lost-forevers by any means.

**Cyan's Dream, Three Dream Stooges (Recommended Party Level 30-35):**

**LOST FOREVER Monsters:** Dahling, Wart Puck, Allurer, PandoraBox

**Blue Magic:** Tsunami, Step Mine, L.2 Holy

* L.2 holy can be learned from Dahling or Allurer  
* Step Mine is sometimes used by Allurer  
* Tsunami is used by Joker if you didn't already learn it

**The Three Dream stooges:**  This should be no trouble at all if your characters have Safety Bits or Jewel Rings to prevent petrify. Remember, Ribbons no longer do this\!  Take out Curley first so he doesn't cast Life2 on the dead brothers, then just fight this battle normally until its over.

**Cyan's Dream, Phantom Train sequence:**

**LOST FOREVER Monsters:** Samurai/Yokai, Joker, Wart Puck, Allurer

**Cyan's Dream, Magitek Armor sequence:**

**Lost Forever Monsters:** M-TekEagle, IO

**NOTE:** The IO has a rare PhaseBlaster steal.  This is the only way to get a second PhaseBlaster if you want two of them for Gogo (not a bad Genji Glove combo). There are better guns later in the game though, so I wouldn't go out of your way to get one...

**Cyan's Dream, Back to Doma Castle:**

**WrexSoul:** I recommend NOT wearing Jewel Rings or any item granting immunity to petrify\! This way, when WrexSoul uses Zinger, you can cast Break on all your characters until WrexSoul reappears, then use a Soft/Remedy on the petrified character(s).   
WrexSoul will not use Zinger as frequently as he used to, but his attacks can do more damage than before. The key is to use physical attacks on him.  If you must use magic, use Ice spells. This battle shouldn't be too difficult.

**NOTE:** WrexSoul has a Memento Ring steal, which is the only way to obtain a 3rd one (and another Shadow-Yoroi). If you really want another Shadow-Yoroi, bring Gogo or Locke along\!

**Ancient Cave (Recommended Party Level 32-37):**

**Monsters (cave area):**  Lamia, Clay Golem/Iron Golem, Wraith

**NOTE:** The Crystal Orb (found inside the Ancient Castle) is different than before. It still increases MP by 50%, but it also boosts Magic Power 25% and Magic Evade 10%. This effectively makes the relic better than a Gold-Hairpin, unless your MP is naturally above 5,000.

**TonberKing (monster-in-a-box):** This battle is quite a bit different from the original. The trick is to cast Slow/SlowX at the start of the battle along with Bio. Fenrir isn't a bad idea to protect your party members against TonberKing's Grudge attack.  After that, I would suggest only having your most powerful characters attack. There is a 1/3 chance TonberKing will counter with Step Mine, which can't be dodged. Immediately revive fallen characters.  Try to keep all 4 characters alive at the end of the battle, since TonberKing will use his Grudge attack twice followed by Step Mine before dying, which could potentially slay 3 of your characters. 

**ITEM GAINED:** The reward for defeating the TonberKing is the Pug Boots. This relic will automatically ensure your character remains in pug status, and will also grant them Jump. It also boosts attack damage by 25% and HP by 12.5%. You can consider this a 5th Pug item for your characters\!

**Ancient Castle:**

**Monsters:** Gargoyle, BloodBones/Ronin, OldenGuard, Sleipnir (rare encounter).

* Sleipnir has a rare Gold Hairpin steal.  
* Bloodbones/Ronin has a rare Murasame steal.  
* OldenGuard has a rare Blood Sword steal.

**TIP:** Sleipnir has 20,000 HP (even more at high levels) and can be a challenge. Holy and Lightning elemental weapons and spells will not work. Equipping your characters with Thunder shields will help. You can also start the battle with Slow. After that, just keep healing and attacking. Try to keep your party as healthy as possible, as there is a chance Sleipnir will cast the new "Lightning" spell on you \- causing some pretty nasty damage unless you have immunity to bolt.

**NOTE:** Sleipnir is one of the best rages for a while, and is highly recommended for Gau\!

**MINOR SPOILERS:** There are 4 mini-bosses in the Ancient Castle total. Below are some tips to beating each one.

**Odin:**  The key to beating Odin is to cause mass amounts of damage before he kills your whole party. He will count down from 4 before killing every party member. Have your mages use Bolt3. Don't worry about defense, as Odin won't attack until 4 turns are over. The other way to beat him is to equip DragoonBoots and jump when Odin is on Count 1\. Keep doing this until you've won.

**ITEM GAINED:** Zantetsuken (previously Scimitar). This sword can be equipped on quite a few characters you would not expect, including Locke and Gogo.

**NOTE:**  The Quick spell is no longer learned from Odin, so there is absolutely no reason to refrain from upgrading Odin to Raiden.  Raiden teaches Meteor and HasteX, which is well worth the upgrade\!

**Yojimbo:** Probably the easiest Mini-boss. Use Bio repeatedly on him, cure your characters, and use your power hitters to bring Yojimbo down. Don't go out of your way to steal from him, as you merely get a Murasame (which can be stolen from other monsters easier).

**ITEM GAINED:** The Offering is the reward here. It is a good choice on Leo at this point, but keep in mind that it will disable the special of any weapon Leo has equipped. If you just don't want to lose those special effects, consider equipping the Offering on Cyan instead. Either way, at this point the Offering should allow for consistently more damage with your warriors, even with the loss of weapon specials.

**Flood Drgn:** Perhaps the hardest mini-boss in the ancient castle, especially if you don't have the right equipment\!  I would equip a piece of pug gear on each character to make them immune to water attacks.  I would also equip ribbons on everyone (and Maduin's Ring on Terra) to block sleep, which the Dragon regularly uses.  The last attack to worry about is Brain Zap, which cannot be blocked, does a decent amount of damage, and will put your characters to sleep if they aren't immune. Pod Bracelets and Marvel shoes will help reduce the damage caused by this attack as well as your strongest armor.   
Flood Drgn has no weaknesses, so just use your strongest spells and power hitters to cause as much damage as possible (I recommend defense-piercing moves like Quadra Slice, Bum Rush, Chainsaw/Drill, Flare, etc.)

**ITEM GAINED:** Flood Dragon will drop the Oceanus Fork, which is a great spear for Edgar and Mog, and will randomly attack with flood.

**Siegfried:** This is a new mini-boss encounter. If you are fighting Siegfried on a low level, your best bet is to just keep using life spells and Phoenix downs as fast as possible as your party members die (Hyper Drive can't be dodged and will likely one-hit kill your characters). Cast slow and poison/Bio on Siegfried. If you have Cyan, use Quadra Slice.   
The Fenrir Esper is a good way to start the battle. Zephyr capes aren't a bad idea either. Once you have poisoned Siegfried, the trick is to just stay alive until he dies\!

**ITEM GAINED:** After defeating Siegfried, you will obtain Excalibur in the treasure chest. It is now an amazing sword for Leo that boosts his Shock and physical damage and randomly procs with a brand new “Holy Sword” special attack. You will want to equip it immediately\!

**Excalibur Side-Quest:**

**SPOILER:** Siegfried mentions going to the Colosseum to look for Excalibur, but you do NOT want to give up the REAL Excalibur\!  Instead, you may head over to the new “Rift Island” with Leo equipped with the Excalibur.  You should then proceed to look for one of the “Rift Spawn” monsters. Alternatively, you may find the Rift Spawn in Kefka’s Tower, although that will take longer.  Encountering Rift Spawn will bring about a surprise boss fight that I will not reveal the identity of. 

**Surprise Boss Tip (Recommended Party Level 36-42):** First of all, it should be noted that you can steal a Genji Helmet from this boss. There are only two in the game including this one, so it’s something you should strongly consider obtaining. Also, this boss uses a lot of Blue magic, so bring Strago if he is behind\! None of the Blue magic learned here is anything you can’t find elsewhere though, mind you. 

Equip fatal magic blocking items and Ribbons, and consider using Life3 on vital characters, if you learned it. This boss is weak to Holy, so use that Excalibur along with Holy elemental attacks/magic. This boss has about 100,000 HP, and will use a powerful attack called “Dark Sword” when about halfway dead that will hurt all characters and cannot be blocked. If you let this boss survive too long, it will continually use Dark Sword after about every 8 turns. Bring it down fast at this point.

**ITEM GAINED:** Beating this surprise boss will grant you the “Excalipoor”, which you can bet at the Colosseum in order to fool Siegfried. However, you are unlikely to obtain the sword at this point of the game, unless your levels are decent, or you have some amazing luck/skills. I have given some tips to fight Siegfried further down in this guide. Winning this fight will grant you Leo's Ultimate Sword.

**Pug Gear Time:**

Although each piece of Pug gear has been mentioned in this document already, here they are again in one section for your convenience:

* Pug Crown: Dropped by the 3 Tonberries in Umaro's Cave (the treasure chest encounter), as well as a rare drop of T-Rexaur outside the Dino-Forest  
* Pug Cloak: Common drop of Tonberry in Umaro's Cave  
* Lantern: Common steal of Tonberry in Umaro's Cave  
* Chef Skewer: Rare drop of Cactuar (desert south of Maranda) and Tyranosaur in the Dino Forest.  Also a rare steal of Tyranosaur.  
* Pug Boots: Dropped by the Tonberking encountered in the treasure chest of the Ancient Cave.   
  **MINOR SPOILER:** You can get more than set of Pug Boots by defeating the elusive Gigantuar in the desert south of Maranda. See the "Best Hunting" section for more info.

**Colosseum time:**

Now is a good time to earn some rare items at the Colosseum (if you haven't already). A good way to consistenly win is to give a character all the Pug Gear, including the Pug Boots you received from the TonberKing in a relic slot. Here are some noteworthy chains of items that you may bet (listed again in the colosseum section below, but with fewer details):

Bone Mallet \-\> Fury Ring \-\> Blizzard Orb \-\> Storm Reaper \-\> Moogle Disk \-\> Skull Helmet \-\> Regal Crown   
\-\> Red Cap \-\> Cat hood \-\> Hypno Crown \-\> Cat Hood  
Two of these items cannot be found very easily: The Blizzard Orb, and Storm Reaper (Umaro's 2nd best weapon). You also can't have too many Red Caps, since just about anyone can equip them.  Bone Mallets are the easiest item to obtain in this chain of items (see the monster list below for steals/drops), but you may also steal a Blizzard Orb from Vectagoyle/Vectaurus in Kefka's Tower. The Storm Reaper pierces defense and randomly casts Aero, which means you should attempt to obtain it as soon as possible\!  
**NOTE:** The Blizzard Orb grants "Ice Storm" this time around, a very nice attack for Umaro. Ice Storm targets all monsters and is defense-piercing. It can be very powerful (much more so than the original Storm).  In addition, Blizzard Orb also grants 25% magic boost, Regen, and Nulls Ice damage with 50% Fire resistance. All in all, this is a great relic for Umaro\!  
Mirage Vest \-\> Red Cap \-\> Cat hood \-\> Hypno Crown \-\> Cat Hood  
This is just another way to get Red Caps if you have extra Mirage Vests rotting in your inventory (I doubt it).   
Royal Jacket \-\> Master's Gi \-\> Genji Armor \-\> Force Armor \-\> Royal Jacket  
The only way to get the Master's Gi for Sabin is to bet a Royal Jacket. A second Royal Jacket can be found in Kefka's Tower so you have the best armor for both Edgar and Sabin.   
The other armors can be found in treasure chests, but are limited. In total, there are x2 Royal Jackets, x2 Force Armors, and x1 Genji Armor. There is no other way to obtain these armors.  
Medusa Bow \-\> Healing Rod \-\> Dancing Claw \-\> Oceanus Fork \-\> Chef Skewer \-\> a whole bunch of commmon items that can be purchased after this...   
The Oceanus Fork is the best spear until another one you can obtain later in Kefka's Tower (excluding the Chef Skewer for Pugs). Medusa Bow may be dropped by the Medusa in Ebot’s Rock, or you may steal Dancing Claw from Ging-Ryu in Zone Eater's Belly if you want more than one.  You also get a Oceanus Fork from Flood Dragon in the Ancient Castle. Trading a Medusa Bow is also the only way to obtain multiple Healing Rods – which some people find as a fairly useful strategy.  
Drake Suit \-\> BehemothSuit \-\> Snow Muffler \-\> BehemothSuit  
The Snow Muffler can only be obtained through the Colosseum, and is the best armor for Gau and Mog (there is better armor for Umaro later). Keep in mind the BehemothSuit is the best armor for Strago, but you can obtain two BehemothSuits \- one dropped by KingBeast in the Veldt Cave and another in Kefka's Tower. If you want a 3rd one, you can steal one from GreatBeast in Kefka's Tower (that would cover Gau, Mog, and Strago).   
**NOTE:** Relm cannot equip these armors; her best armor is now the Drake suit, which is stolen by WhiteDrake/Sun Drake in Zone Eater's Belly or DarkDragon/NecroDemon in Kefka's Tower.  
Magus Rod \-\> Stardust Rod \-\> Magus Rod  
Stardust Rod can only be obtained at the Colosseum, and is Strago's best weapon. You will receive only one Magus Rod from RubyDragon, although you can also steal them from a certain monster in Kefka’s Tower if you want more than one.  The Stardust Rod has a brand new feature, and that is “MP Regen”.  When equipped on Strago, he will replenish MP during a battle, just like with HP Regen (you can also have both statuses together).  
Tintinabulum \-\> Charm Bangle \-\> Marvel Shoes \-\> Tintinabulum  
This is how you get the Marvel shoes. You can get Tintinabulum as a rare drop and steal from the Tonberry in Umaro's Cave.  
Gold Hairpin \-\> Muscle Belt \-\> Hero Ring

All these items may be stolen or dropped by various monsters (see monster section), but if you have too many of one and desire another, this is an easy way to swap them.

Ribbon \-\> Muscle Belt \-\> Hero Ring  
The same as above, but using a Ribbon to start this chain instead of a Gold Hairpin.  
Gold Fist \-\> Gauntlet \-\> Genji Glove \-\> Gauntlet  
This is merely a way to swap one of these rare items for another in the event you have too many of one.  
Memento Ring \-\> Shadow-Yoroi \-\> Memento Ring  
This is also listed above in the guide. There are two Memento Ring's in the game; I recommend betting one of them for Shadow's awesome armor, which can be equipped on quite a few characters\! It also has an unlisted attribute of changing Setzer’s “GilToss” to “Throw”.  
Safety Bit \-\> Dragon Horn \-\> Ace Shot \-\> Gold Fist \-\> Gauntlet \-\> Genji Glove  
There is only one Safety bit, Dragon Horn, and Ace Shot found in the game. The only way to get more than one is a rare Safety Bit steal from a monster in the Phoenix Cave (see below), a rare steal from Zalera (one of the 3 statues), or by encountering and defeating an elusive beast and trading the item you win (see the "Beast Hunting" section). You can also use the Esper Ragnarok to morph certain monsters into a Safety Bit (see the morph section).  
Blood Sword \-\> Soul Staff \-\> Blood Sword  
These are found commonly (search the monster file for rare drops and steals), but it's nice knowing you can swap one for another.

Thunder Shld \-\> Aegis Shield \-\> Genji Shield \-\> Lantern  
This combination is handy only if you want to swap one shield for another. In particular, Aegis Shields are equippable by all characters while Thunder Shields are not, so it's often a good idea to trade in those Thunder Shields if you have too many. You can steal Thunder shields from a certain monster in Kefka's Tower (see the monster section) or Morph them from several monsters (see the Morph section).  
Force Helmet \-\> Force Shield \-\> Force Helmet  
Two of each are found in the game, but if for some reason you like one more than another, you can swap them this way.

**Phoenix Cave (Recommended Party Level 35-42):**

**Monsters:**  Ghoul, Allosaurus, Lost Soul, Wizard, Sekhmet, Catoblepas, Remnant, Tot Aevis (rare), Brontaur (rare)

**Blue Magic:** Vortex

* Vortex May be learned by encountering the semi-rare monster "Tot Aevis", having Gau learn the rage, and using the Rage in battle with Strago present.   
* I recommend bringing Leo, Sabin, Umaro, and Cyan (and split them up into the 2 parties as you see fit) along with supporting mages for healing.  The warriors will come in handy in the Phoenix cave.  Most monsters are undead, so Sabin's Godhand and Leo's Excalibur will deal a lot of damage. Umaro is powerful with his normal attacks, and Cyan will do well with Quadra Slice.  
* Watch out for Tot Aevis and Brontaur, as they are a challenge. Sometimes it is wise to flee if you are ill-prepared. The usual Fenrir/Image and Shell/Zoneseek will help you win these battles.  Both of these monsters also have great rages for Gau\!

There are a few rare steals and drops in this cave:

* Tot Aevis \- rare Safety Bit steal  
* Brontaur \- rare Genji Glove drop  
* Wizard \- rare Healing Rod steal  
* Allosaurus \- rare X-potion steal  
* Sekhmet \- Rare X-Ether steal

**RubyDragon:** This is among the easier Dragon encounters. Equip your characters with Flame Shields and/or Force Shields and Force Armor along with relics blocking magic (such as prayer beads). 

A character with Pug gear is also handy. Spam the Dragon with Ice-based spells and attacks and it should be over before long.

**ITEM GAINED:** You will get a Magus Rod from RubyDragon, which is a nice enough rod \- or you can trade it at the Colosseum for the even nicer Stardust Rod\!  Keep in mind that the Stardust Rod can only be used by Strago, while the Magus Rod can also be used by Terra (this might even be better than White Bow for Terra).

**SPOILER:** There is a new optional mini-boss in the Phoenix Cave. When you get Locke, you may notice a treasure chest sitting on the right side of the screen. You will have to go back through the whole cave a second time to where Locke was standing and hop across the rocks (to the right) to get this treasure chest. This triggeres a monster-in-a-box:  
**Gi Nattak:**  
This fight can be hard without the proper party. If you have trouble, try sending in a mage or two witih Leo. Give Leo a Gauntlet \+ Excalibur. Focus on having Leo attack every turn. Excalibur should deal massive damage against this boss, since it is undead.  Just keep your mages reviving/healing the party while Leo wins the battle. Alternatively, you can Morph Terra and use Fire3, which sould deal 9,999 damage. You can use other healers to keep her alive. Give all the characters armor and relics to dodge attacks (Zephyr Cape, Defender, etc.)  Use Fenrir at the start of the battle. You can also give one of your characters all the Pug gear, which makes them immune to all attacks except Flare. Gi Nattak is weak against Fire and Holy, so use both accordingly. Once Gi Nattak is under about 15,000 HP, he will attack each party member once followed by a 2/3 chance of using Flare or a 1/3 chance of using his Special. Take him down fast at this point to end the battle\! 

**SPOILER \#2:** Winning this battle will result in... A SWORD OF RAGNAROK\! You heard right \- now you can have both the Esper and the sword\! Read the next section for more information regarding Raganrok.

**Narshe Revisited, the Ragnarok Esper:**

* Once you get Locke, it's time to revisit Narshe. This time, there is NO CHOICE between getting the Esper or the Sword; you get the Esper by default now. This is explained in the spoiler coming up shortly, but first some info about the Esper:  
* The Ragnarok Esper no longer teaches Ultima; rather, it teaches Comet (new spell), Merton, and Cure3 (at a faster rate than Starlet).  
* Merton is a much better spell this time around and will only target monsters as opposed to your own party.  
* Morph will make it easier to obtain some rare items, although these items can typically also be stolen and/or dropped by monsters.  See the Morph section below for a complete list\!

**SPOILER:** There are TWO swords of Ragnarok in the game that can now be obtained\!  The first was already mentioned in the previous Spoiler section (Phoenix Cave). The second is a rare auction in Jidoor. In order for the sword of Ragnarok to appear at Auction, you MUST purchase the Hero Ring first\! Keep in mind the sword might cost anywhere from 120,000 \- 200,000 gil, so make sure you have enough on hand to win the sword.

The reason for having two swords of Ragnarok in the game is the following: the Ragnarok sword can ONLY be equipped by Terra, but you can bet one of the Ragnarok swords for the Illumina at the Colosseum, which can ONLY be equipped by Celes\! For this reason, you will want to keep one of each: The Ragnarok for Terra, and the Illumina for Celes. This gives both of them their own unique piece of ultimate equipment.

**Narshe Revisited, the cursed shield:**

The Cursed Shield is in the usual place. You can uncurse it after fighting 128 battles with it equipped to obtain the Paladin Shield (it used to be 256).  It should be noted that the Paladin Shield no longer teaches Ultima. It is simply an awesome shield now that is very beneficial in Kefka's Tower and beyond.

NOTE: Both Umaro and Gogo can uncurse the shield now\!

**More Colosseum stuff:**

Ragnarok \-\> Illumina \-\> Ragnarok

I think this requires no explanation except that Ragnarok can only be equipped by Terra while Illumina can only be equipped by Celes. This is explained just above in the Narshe Revisited section.   
It is in fact possible to have BOTH swords in your possession as well as the Ragnarok Esper\!

**Colosseum  (SPOILER):**

Excalipoor \-\> Dark Eternal

* Dark Eternal is the most difficult item to obtain at the Colosseum.  You must first get Excalipoor, which is dropped by defeating a certain boss (see the “Excalibur side-quest” section above). You must face Siegfried at the colosseum to get the Dark Eternal. This fight is extremely difficult, especially below level 45-50.  
* The easiest way to survive is to get a character above 5,500 HP (Muscle belts certainly help) so you can survive HyperDrive.  
* Another alternative is to send Terra, Celes, or Relm in and cast Bio on Siegfried at the very start of the battle.  While his HP are slowly depleted, use Life3 on yourself every time HyperDrive kills you. Zepyr Capes and the Defender sword will help to dodge his other attacks.   
  Dragoonboots are also a good idea so you can keep jumping while Siegfried dies of poison.   
* Another possible idea is to equip a merit award and the Master's Gi to block/counter attacks. Whatever strategy you use, it will certainly involve some luck to win\!  
* **AUTHOR'S NOTE:** If you find an easy way to defeat Siegfried, I will be curious to know how you did it \- so drop me a line over at Discord (see the credits file for contact information).   
* **Dark Eternal Notes:** This sword can be considered Leo’s best, although Excalibur is still better under certain circumstances. The Dark Eternal will ignore the monsters defense entirely, and will never miss. This means if a monster has very high defense, the Dark Eternal will continue dealing mass amounts of damage, while the Excalibur does very little. However, if you are facing a monster with lower defense, Excalibur might deal more damage than the Dark Eternal due to its high critical hit ratio.  My suggestion is to consider equipping Leo with his Magi Exosuit, and give him BOTH of these swords at the same time, since they complement each other well.   
  **Dark Eternal \+ Offering Note:** It should be noted that the Offering will turn the Dark Eternal into a normal sword that no longer ignores defense, and can also miss.  However, it still has the potential to deal mass damage if you give Leo a Gauntlet \+Offering+Dark Eternal. This can especially be useful in the dino-forest if you wish to level-grind Leo.

**Fanatic's Tower (Recommended Party Level 37-45):**

**Monsters:** Magic Pot \- this is the only monster that appears in the Veldt

* The obvious party here consists of Terra, Celes, Relm, and Gogo \- the only characters that can use magic.  
* **WARNING:** If you bring Mog, MagiMaster will be much, much harder (although he is beatable). If you choose to walk up the tower the hard way WITHOUT a moogle charm, then MagiMaster will be easier\!  This is your reward for doing it the hard way.  
* If you don't feel like dealing with wall rings or reflect, simply teach everyone Comet (learned from either Crusader or Ragnarok). Comet ignores reflect status and will deal lots of damage against ALL monsters in the tower.   
* I would also equip someone with the esper Odin/Raiden. You can instantly kill all monsters exept Lv40, Lv60, and Lv90 Magic. X-zone also works, but is not as accurate.   
* Make sure everyone is floating\! Lv60 Magic will use Quake for mass damage otherwise.  
* The biggest threat in the tower is Lv90 Magic. You can use stop, muddle, or poison to help \- but they must be reflected off one of your characters. Otherwise, just spam Comet to bring him down as fast as possible.

**Magi-Pot (monster-in-a-box):** This will be an interesting battle. The Magi-Pot will do absolutely nothing until you damage it or 80 seconds passes by. All elements are absorbed by the Magi-Pot, so you must use non-elemental attacks.   
Magi-Pot will then cast Reflect on itself and proceed to attack each character with "Magi-Blast", which is actually a powerful physical attack, followed by Fire3/Ice3/Bolt3, then North Cross/Pug Song/Lullaby, then finally Flare.   
After this, Magi-Pot will go dormant until you attack it again, and repeat the process. You will want to use Fenrir before attacking Magi-Pot, or Image individually on each character.   
Shell is also a good idea. After this, you can begin casting Comet, Flare, or Meteor, and heal or bring your characters back to life if Magi-Pot deals any damage. When reflect runs out for Magi-Pot, you will have an opportunity to heal everyone and re-cast Image. If you are unprepared and have none of the non-elemental spells, your only other option is to cast berserk on someone wielding some good non-elemental weapons.    
Magi-Pot does not actually have great physical defense, so this is a viable option to win, although it will takelonger. If you use this strategy, just make sure the person you want to berserk doesn't have a Ribbon (although the other characters could use a Ribbon). When you win this battle, Magi-Pot will use a Megalixir on your entire party, then disappear.

**ITEM GAINED:** Force Shield

**White Dragon/Holy Dragon:** This fight can be hard if you aren't prepared, but is actually quite easy when you are.  Unlike the original FF6, Mute does NOT work here, but you can use slow or stop.  White Dragon will counter your spells with Mute, Dispel, or a fairly powerful physical attack. As such, it might be wise to enter the battle with ribbons and possibly the Fenrir esper to avoid the physical attacks.

White Dragon is weak to the poisonelement and/or dark, although it cannot actually be poisoned. You can of course just stick with Comet to inflict lots of damage. White Dragon will use reflect on itself below 17,500 HP, but at this point you could just use Comet, Meteo, or Merton to avoid messing around with reflect on your own party members. That's really all there is to it\!

**ITEM GAINED:** You get a Force Helmet for winning, which can be equipped on all characters and offers some nice physical and magical defense as well as 20% Magic block.

**MagiMaster:** If you make it to the top without Mog, MagiMaster isn't too difficult. Cast life3 on someone for when MagiMaster dies to survive Ultima. Just know that Berserk will NOT work anymore\!

I would start the battle with ShellX on everyone, then proceed to spam Comet.  If MagiMaster uses Shell on himself, use Dispel to remove it (so Comet will deal more damage).  Beware that MagiMaster can sometimes use Meteor, Comet, and Merton.  Just be prepared to heal, and don't forget Life3\! If your characters are on lower levels, a few Muscle Belts and Red Caps isn't a bad idea to beef up their HP.  

**NOTE:** If you bring Mog and wish to face the much harder MagiMaster, I would use the same tactics as above, but cast Berserk on Mog so he can fight, and use Life3 on everyone right away. MagiMaster will use Ultima after about 10 turns regardless of whether or not he is dead\! It would be wise to take him down fast with Comet, or you will spend much of the battle reviving characters and using up valuable resources... 

You might want to be higher than level 35-40 in order to face MagiMaster WITH Mog in your party. You can actually defeat him on a lower level if you walk through the tower without Mog.

**ITEM GAINED (in the treasure chest):**  Economizer. There is no more Gem Box, but the Economizer is exciting enough, right?  It will reduce MP usage 75%.

**Leveling time:**

If you managed to get this far at or below level 35 average, you might consider gaining some levels before heading to Kefka's Tower (although I'm sure someone out there can pull it off). The best place to level at this point is in and around the dinosaur forest.  All monsters there give a considerable amount of Exp. If you aren't strong enough to face the Tyranosaur yet, fight the monsters outside the forest. Most of these monsters are extremely powerful with physical attacks, but if you use Fenrir, Image, or Vanish, they are much easier.  Read the section above (obtaining the Falcon) for more information about other good areas to level up on.

**Kefka's Tower (Recommended Party Level 42-50+):**

* Be well prepared before tackling Kefka's Tower, as it is not the same tower you remember\! Some random encounters you cannot flee from, and all of them are much harder than the original game.  
* Most of the monsters are completely new\!  
* I would recommend tackling the tower in several stages. The first visit should be to obtain the treasures, while the later visits should be for defeating the 3 statues, doing optional beast hunting (if you so desire), then finally returning to face Kefka.

**Monsters encountered in the tower, listed by area:**

**Outside areas:** GreatBeast, Bolla, Vampworm, Evil Oscar

**Inside "junk" hallways:** Vectagoyle/Vectaurus, DarkDragon/NecroDemon, DoomDragon

**Magitek lab areas:** Automaton, Red Giant/Blue Giant, Iron Lich/Death Mask, Guard Bot/Monolith, Searcher, Dreadnaut (test tube area), Prototype (in the very last magitek area with the 3 buttons).

**Jail Cells, Small Hallways:** Retainer, Hemophyte, Warrioress, Duelist, Oni

**Area with steps after the jail cells (after the Ultima weapon):** Iron Giant, Jumbo Flan

**Dragon rooms, Guardian area:** Didalos, EvilEye

**NOTE:** There are some monsters missing here that are listed in the next "Beast Hunting" section

**Blue Magic:** Beam, Quasar, Vortex

If you missed Vortex in the Phoenix Cave, you can learn it easier by fighting Vectagoyle/Vectaurus. It has about a 2/3 chance of using it after 4 turns.

* **Beam** can be learned easily from Red Giant/Blue Giant.  It is a powerful, defense piercing single target spell (more powerful than Dark). It is non-elemental and will work on any monster/boss.  
* **Quasar** is the toughest Blue magic to learn, but this time around it's more powerful than Grand Train and the most powerful Blue magic you can have (although it eats up a lot of MP).  
  To learn Quasar, you have to face the elusive beast called the "Atlas".  See the "Beast Hunting" section below for more details.

**Here are some rare steals and drops among the regular encounters in Kefka's tower:**

* Dreadnaut \- rare War Claw steal and Chainsaw drop \- The War Claw is a great second weapon for Sabin. It has a high critical ratio and will randomly attack with Shrapnel on all monsters.  
* Retainer \- rare Samurai Mail steal \- Cyan's Best armor\!  
* Warrioress \- rare Heroine Gown steal and White Shield drop – the best armor for Celes and the best shield for Terra, Celes, and Relm (besides situation uses for other shields and/or the Paladin shield).  
* Prototype \- rare Rocket Punch steal and drop  
* GreatBeast \- rare BehemothSuit steal  
* Duelist \- rare Defender steal and Beast Slayer drop  
* Hemophyte \- rare Masamune steal  
* Bolla \- rare Muscle Belt steal  
* Vectagoyle/Vectaurus \- rare Blizzard Orb (can be bet for the Storm Reaper at colosseum)  
* DarkDragon/NecroDemon \- rare Drake Suit steal \- Relm's best armor if you haven't already obtained one\!  
* DoomDragon \- rare Skull Helmet steal \- Umaro's best helmet, although you likely already have one by now  
* Automaton \- rare Debilitator steal  
* Red Giant/Blue Giant \- rare M-Tek Rifle steal  
* Iron Giant \- rare Thunder Shld steal  
* Oni \- rare Gold Hairpin steal  
* Didalos \- rare Hero Ring steal  
* Evil Eye \- rare Magus Rod steal  
* Iron Lich/Death Mask – rare Zephyr Cape steal 

**NOTE:** The War Claw, Samurai Mail, and Heroine Gown can ONLY be obtained by the monsters listed above in Kefka's tower, or by morphing a few monsters (see the morph section below). It's also possible to steal a rare Heroine Gown from Minerva, but that is much harder than stealing one from Warrioress (not worth the attempt in my opinion). 

**TREASURE TIP:** There is a new helmet for Celes in a treasure chest in Kefka’s Tower (the outside area), and that is the Lumina Halo.  This helmet will regenerate MP during a battle, similar to the Stardust Rod for Strago. It should definitely be her top helmet choice\!

**Boss strategies:**

**Ultima Weapon:** Probably the easiest boss in Kefka's Tower, although a bit harder than the original ATMA from FF6.  It should be noted that after you attack Ultima 12 times, he will flash yellow and cast Ultima on you. It is survivable with enough HP, or you can use Life3 in preparation. Besides this, I would just use Shell on your party, keep a healer going, and attack with your warriors.

**NOTE:** Ultima has a rare Crystal Orb steal, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get one...

**SteelGiant:** This one can be a challenge. Using Fenrir at the start of the battle is almost a must\! Any time one of your characters loses Image, it's a good idea to cast it again individually, as needed.  Any time the SteelGiant calls in an Absorber and Automaton, it might be wise to take them out first, or Absorber will absorb your magic.   
Automaton will sometimes use Cold Dust on you, which can cause problems if you don't have the means to unfreeze them via Fire. Use all your defense piercing moves on the SteelGiant, as its defense and magic defense is very high. Be prepared to bring characters back to life any time SteelGiant uses Dice Up. This battle will take time to win, but it is doable even on slightly lower levels. 

**Uncle Ulty & Ziegfried (monster-in-a-box):** Ultros is back, at least one last time\! He seems more friendly this time around, and honestly isn't too difficult...    
Ziegfried, on the other hand, can be tricky with his new counter attack of HyperDrive/ShockWave/Shrapnel.  You have nothing to worry about from Ziegfried's physical attacks, as they will do 0-1 damage every time (just like on the Phantom Train).    
Ziegfried actually only has 100 HP, but with 3 "lives". You must attack him 3 times (dealing over 100 damage) to win. It should be over quick, but his counter attacks can also be lethal. 

Ultros can also pack a punch with Tentacle if you aren't careful.  You will need to deal 40,000 damage to Ultros to win.

**ITEM GAINED:** Ultros will reward you with the Aspergillum, Relm's incredibly awesome Brush that will randomly call the Esper Alexander. The Brush is Holy Elemental and also boosts magic power 25%

**GoldDragon:** The GoldDragon has a lot of HP, but in general the fight isn't hard.  Equip Thunder Shields on as many party members as you can, use Fenrir/Image, and just use your most powerful attacks.

**ITEM GAINED:** Dragon Horn \- which should require no explanation\! It allows multi-jump when combined with DragoonBoots, just as in the original game. Note that the maximum number of jumps is now 3\.

**Necro Drgn:** This is probably the hardest boss fight until now, and might require a few attempts (especially at lower levels). I would equip Safety Bits/Shadow-Yoroi/Memento Ring/Wild Heart as well as Ribbons or other items that block poison. Some Flame Shields are also not a bad idea. Force Shields work almost as well. Use Fenrir to block the Dragon's incredibly lethal "Bone Crusher" move, and use ShellX to reduce damage from various other spells. It might be wise to bring Strago and have him use White Wind every single turn (giving him an Economizer is not a bad idea).

Big Guard is also a good idea at the start of the battle. Bring another mage to cast life2 on dead party members.

Necro Drgn is weak against Holy, so I would bring Leo and Sabin and have them destroy the Dragon quickly with the Godhand and Excalibur, both of which are holy elemental weapons. Otherwise, you can have your mages cast Holy if they get a break from healing. If you have Gau in your party, consider using “White Drake/Sun Drake”, since it will attack with Necro Dragon’s weakness of Holy as well as heal the party with Sun Bath. Necro Drgn is also susceptible to L.2 Holy, so consider using that. Gau has access to L.2 Holy with the “Pumpkin” Rage.

**ITEM GAINED:** Necro Dragon will drop the Bone Mail \- Umaro's best armor.  It blocks all fatal magic as well as poison.

**Guardian:** This fight can be rough if you aren’t ready. It takes patience to eat away at Guardian's Health. He has a 1/3 chance of repairing himself with every attack (2/3 at higher levels), so you will only want to attack with your most powerful moves.   
Preferably, you will want to deal more than 3,000 damage per turn, which is more than Guardian can repair.  If you let Guardian survive for too long, you risk it using Ultima against you \- but that takes many, many turns. It is survivable, but will definitely make life more difficult.

**The Three Statues:**

**Brynhildr:** You can steal a Storm Reaper, although you should already have one by now (won from the colosseum; see above). 

Brynhildr does substantially more damage with physical attacking than in the original game, but the strategy is mostly the same. I recommend using Fenrir at the start of the battle. 

Equip your characters with safety Bits, Memento Rings, the Shadow-Yoroi, etc. to block the nasty Blaster attack. Simply use your most powerful physical attacks and magic, and you should be able to win.

**ITEM GAINED:** You will obtain the Gungnir for defeating Brynhildr. This is the best spear you can have for a non-pugged Edgar or Mog. It is lightning elemental, and will randomly cast "Lightning" on all monsters. The special also works with DragoonBoots \+ Dragon Horn, so this weapon is definitely a great fit for Dragoons\!

**Zalera:** First of all, you no longer have to bring Strago to this fight, since Force Field no longer exists (as of ASC version 2.0). There is a rare Safety Bit steal if you can be bothered; personally, I wouldn't work too hard to get this, since there are other ways. The strategy is mostly the same as with Brynhildr. Equip safety Bits, Memento Rings, Shadow-Yoroi, and other fatal magic blockers. Fenrir at the start of the battle is useful to block the powerful physical attacks of Zalera. Your warriors are better for this battle, as Zalera has higher magical defense than physical defense. Sabin with the Godhand or Leo with the Excalibur should end this battle quickly, since Zalera is weak to Holy.

**ITEM GAINED:** Zalera will grant you the Zanmato \- Cyan's best sword.  The Zanmato can perform a Multi-strike just like Sabin's Godhand, and also boosts criticals 25%.  The Zanmato works well alongside the Masamune if you decide to give Cyan a Genji Glove (although his defense will take a hit).

**Minerva:** There is a rare Heroine Gown steal, although it's much easier to steal one from the Warrioress. Minerva can be the most tricky of the three statues to beat. Do NOT equip Ribbons/Maduin's Ring\! The problem with these relics is that Minerva's most deadly move, Overcast, will bypass the zombie block of these relics \- but now the zombie status cannot be undone since you aren't immune to fatal magic. Instead, equip safety Bits, Memento Rings, Shadow-Yoroi, and other fatal magic blockers. These will stop Overcast from working altogether. If Love Token is used on you, then simply stop using the "Fight" command and instead rely on anything else (blitz, tools, bushido, magic, throw, etc.)   
Love token will only absorb the Fight command. DO NOT equip holy-based or thunder-based weapons like Excalibur, Godhand, Gungnir, etc. since Minerva will absorb those elements\!  

After you attack Minerva 8 times, she will use Overcast \- a very deadly move if you aren't immune to fatal magic. Once you are immune to fatal magic and avoid the Fight command, this battle is just a matter of healing and attacking with the special skills of your characters.  

Shell is not a bad idea to lower the damage caused by Minerva's Lightning, Inferno, and other attacks.

**ITEM GAINED:** Minerva will drop the MinervaCrown \- which is the best helmet for Terra.  It will reduce magic usage 50% just like a Gold Hairpin while offering great defense.

The next section covers optional Beast hunting and the ultimate item gathering. If you don't want to face  these big, bad monsters and gather the ultimate items, you may skip the next section and proceed straight to the Final Boss Battle section.

## Elusive Beast Hunting (AND ULTIMATE ITEM GATHERING)

**There are a total of 12 optional elusive beasts you may hunt for:** 
* 2 Beasts are available at any time in the overworld.   
* 4 are available at Kefka's Tower, also at any time.   
* Another 4 are available at the new “Rift Island”, but only after you have unlocked them by defeating the other 4 beasts in Kefka’s Tower.  Alternatively, they appear in Kefka’s Tower with your party above level 70\.  
* The final beast is available at Kefka’s Tower, but ONLY after you have defeated the 4 higher ranking beasts.  
* Yet another optional beast is available after you have defeated the “Final beast”, as of ASC version 2.0.

**NOTE:** Each of these elusive beasts has a unique item drop or steal, and 6 of them can even be learned by Gau. There are also two blue magic spells to be learned:  Quasar and Quick.

**Elusive Beasts of the Overworld (Recommended Party Level 32-40+):**

**Gigantuar:** Available at any time in the Desert south of Maranda (1/32 chance of encountering the Gigantuar south of Maranda).

* Only defense-piercing, accurate moves will harm Gigantuar \- although it's sometimes possible to hit him unlike Cactuar.  This means using a Sniper Sight and/or attacking with Drill, Bushido, etc.    
* The trick to beating Gigantuar is to protect your party members against his lethal move, Knockdown. He has a 2/3 chance of countering with Knockdown. I recommend using Fenrir and/or Image. A Defender sword or Zephyr cape also helps.  
* I would also recommend boosting everyone's HP with muscle belts, red caps, royal jacket, cat hood, etc.  Even with protection against knockdown, Gigantuar will still get you with Blow Fish.   
* By his 3rd turn, Gigantuar will use x3 Blow Fish.    
* When you kill Gigantuar, he will use x10 Blow Fish. For this reason, you need to be prepared to survive 10,000 damage\! If you have learned Life3, it can help you survive his barrage of Blow Fish at the end.

**ITEM GAINED:** Gigantuar drops the Pug Boots, which is the only way to obtain more than one (you also get one from the Tonberking in the cave to the ancient castle).  

**RAGE:** Gigantuar's rage allows Gau to use his "Sting Blow" desperate attack as a normal move half of the time, with a normal attack the other half. This rage is universally useful since Sting Blow will never miss and pierces defense\!

**Haniwa:** Available at any time in the Dinosaur Forest (1/64 chance of finding it, which is 4x as rare as Brachosaur).

* Haniwa has incredibly high magic and physical defense, so defense piercing spells and attacks are recommended. Float is almost a necessity for this battle along with Shield/Shell. Image definitely doesn't hurt either.   
* Beyond this, the trick is to just keep healing and causing as much damage per turn as possible \- especially since Haniwa will slowly regenerate throughout the battle.    
* Haniwa has a different amount of HP depending on how high your level is.  If you are above level 70, Haniwa has nearly 200,000 HP.  Below level 50 and Haniwa has 65,500 (which is still quite a lot). This fight takes more patience than anything else\!

**ITEM GAINED:** Haniwa drops the Kupo shades or more rarely, a Safety Bit (and lots of Exp). 

The Kupo shades can make Mog a very powerful character if used right\!  He will attack 4 times in a row (like offering) and will be granted Haste, HP \+50%, Attack \+25%, and Vigor \+50%.  The catch is that Mog will also be berserked. You can technically give him a ribbon in the other slot if you really want the benefits without berserk.  I also recommend equipping the Moogle Disk so that Mog will never miss and will pierce defense.

**RAGE:** Haniwa grants Gau Wild Bear and Whump, which is the only way for Gau to summon animals.  Wild Bear is more powerful than Meteor, is defense-piercing, and targets all monsters.  Whump is a very powerful single-target move, although it will not attack floating monsters.    
All-in-all, Haniwa is a powerful rage to have.

**COLOSSEUM TIME:** Betting the Kupo Shades at the Colosseum will reward you with a Pug Gavel, but a character of yours will have to face a Brachosaur alone. 

* Some ideas to win are to give someone all the pug gear and repeatedly jump \- hoping that Disaster and Step mine don't kill you first.   
* Another idea is to get someone like Leo to 255 defense along with a Ribbon to block Disaster. Assuming Step Mine isn't killing you in one hit  
* Use X-potions every time you are low on HP, and keep attacking with your most powerful weapon. 

**Item Gained:** The Pug Gavel is the second Pug weapon in the game (after Chef Skewer). If you ever dreamed of having a Pug that is NOT a Dragoon, then the Pug Gavel is a perfect fit.

* This weapon pierces defense and randomly attacks with Step Mine. It also grants permanent pug status.   
* It should NOT be used alongside the Pug Boots, since the damage output is not increased for jump.   
* The Pug Gavel is a great fit for characters that aren't good Dragoons.   
* Umaro is a force to be reckoned with if given the Pug Gavel combined with the Blizzard Orb and possibly the Fury Ring (and of course the rest of the Pug Gear), since he can continue using Ice Storm.

**Another Colosseum Tip:** If you have quite a few sets of Kupo shades and/or Pug Gavels, you may bet the Pug Gavel for a Safety Bit, the Safety bit for a Dragon Horn, and the Dragon Horn for a second Ace Shot. This Works well with Setzer and a Genji Glove, although he has to sacrifice a shield of course.

**Kefka's Tower Elusive Beasts (Recommended Party Level 45+):**

These 4 beasts will appear in Kefka's Tower at any time, although they might be very tough below about level 45\. Some of these beasts can be found at multiple locations throughout the tower, but I have listed the best place to encounter each of them.

**Arch-Beast:** Best found in the Guardian room area with the save point after the room with 3 buttons (1/4 chance here).

* Arch-Beast is the "easiest" of the four beasts to defeat, although sometimes it can catch you off guard if you get unlucky enough. The strategy should not be complex. Use ShellX/ShldX on all characters, heal when necessary, bring back to life when necessary, and use your most powerful attacks.  
* Leo, Umaro, Sabin, and Cyan can deal a lot of physical damage against this beast. Mages can do a lot of damage with Comet, Flare, or Ultima.  Strago can use Beam, Step Mine, or Grand Train.  
* Once the Arch-Beast is below about 15,000 HP, it will start using nastier spells like Lightning, Meteor, and Vortex.  When you see these spells, it's time to finish the fight quickly\!  
* Arch-Beast has 60,000 HP, although once you get above level 55, that amount of HP doubles to 120,000.  Arch-Beast will also become harder after level 65, and MUCH harder after level 75 (more attacks, counters, and healing).

**ITEM GAINED:** Arch-Beast has a rare Cursed Ring steal (1/8 chance). You can always steal the cursed ring and run away if you wish to gather more than one (which is not a bad idea).  
Unlike the original game, you CAN in fact uncurse the ring after fighting 128 battles with it equipped to obtain the very nice Paladin Ring\! The Paladin Ring is basically a Hero Ring, Ribbon, and Safety Bit all in one.  
**NOTE:** If you equip a Cursed Ring on more than one character to uncurse it, the game will still uncurse only ONE of the rings, but at a faster rate. So, if you have 2 cursed rings equipped, you need to fight 64 battles to uncurse one of the rings.  With 3 rings equipped, only 43 battles.  With 4 rings, only 32 battles.  It's not a bad idea to steal more rings than you need just so you can uncurse them faster (but not necessarily uncurse all of them).  
**ITEM GAINED \#2:** Arch-Beast also has a rare drop: the Exp. Egg – which is a great way to level your characters if you wish to face the higher ranking beasts mentioned in the next section\! 

**RAGE:** With this Rage, Gau will use Comet half the time, and x3.5 battle the other half.  Arch-Beast can potentially cause more damage than any other rage if the monster in question has moderate or average physical/magical defense.

**Adamantor**: Best found in the big room with the stairs after the jail cell room that had Ultima weapon. This room also has the Iron Giants in it. There is about a 1/16 chance of finding Adamantor here, although that chance increases with your party above level 50\.

* Only defense piercing moves will work. Physical attacks with normal weapons are useless.   
* Use Blitz, Bushido, Tools, and magic like Flare and Ultima.   
* Strago should use Beam, Step Mine, Dark, Grand Train, or Quasar.    
* It is almost a must to start the battle with Fenrir and/or use Image on each party member.  Otherwise, Adamantor will deal a lot of damage.   
* Petrify will be used on a regular basis, so immunity to petrify is suggested.  
* Adamantor has about 45,000 HP.  
* When Adamantor is below about 7,000 HP, he will begin to use powerful spells like Rock Slide and Vortex more frequenly. Be sure to take him out fast at this point\!  
* If a random party member is above level 60, Adamantor will have twice the amount of HP (about 90,000 total).

**ITEM GAINED:** You have a 1/8 chance of obtaining an Adamant Fist as a rare drop from Adamantor (Gau's best weapon). This can also be traded at the Colosseum for the Adamant Mail \- Leo's Best armor by far\!  If you can stomach it, I recommend farming 2 Adamant Fists to get both of these great items.

**NOTE:** There is about a 1/16 chance that the Ragnarok Esper morph will work against Adamantor and turn it into an Adamant fist. Although it’s a low chance, it’s still worth attempting. You would not only get an Adamant Fist if it succeeds, but you will have effectively killed Adamantor in a single turn.

**RAGE:** The Adamantor may might not seem like a good rage at first – with only a x2.5 Battle (compared to Iron Giant which is x4.5).  However, the Adamantor will use the x2.5 Battle EVERY turn, rather than sometimes wasting a turn with regular “Fight”. In addition, it will also never miss (100% accuracy). The average damage amount will start to rack up with this rage. Also, if you get the Adamant fist, the Rock Slide special has a chance to work every turn, adding to the damage.

**COLOSSEUM TIP:** If you have trouble obtaining an Adamant Fist from Adamantor AND happen to have lots of Cursed Rings sitting in your inventory, you may Uncurse the rings and trade the Paladin Ring for an Adamant Fist. Your oponent will be Adamantor, which is very difficult to win with just one character. My best advice is to send in a character with 255 defense and the Float status, otherwise Adamantor's special will annihilate you, and so will Quake. The issue will also be piercing through Adamantor's 254 defense. An idea is to equip Leo with the Ultima Weapon, Genji Shield/Paladin Shld, Genji Armor, Genji Helmet, Magi Exosuit, and a Paladin Ring (you should have two since you are willing to part with one, right?). This will get Leo's defense to 255, protect him from petrify, and his Ultima Weapon will be able to penetrate Adamantor's defense. All you have to worry about at this point is Adamantor using Rock Slide, in which case Leo should heal himself with an X-potion or Elixir. I'm sure someone has another idea out there (maybe a character with all the Pug equipment can also win).

**Omega:** Best encountered in the test tube magitek section (the very long room) with about a 1/12 chance.

* You need to be well-prepared for this fight\!  Omega is in fact weak to Lightning and Water, but has a 1/3 chance of countering with Shock Wave. I recommend throwing up the usual defenses \- ShellX, ShldX, and possibly Image. Be prepared to heal characters and bring them back to life, especially when Omega decides to use HyperDrive. Physical attacks and most magic will work against Omega.  
* The battle should be shorter, but intense. The move you want to watch out for is Omega Rays, which ignores defense and is non-elemental.  Your party will take quite a bit of damage from this attack. The only way to prepare is to make sure your party stays healed, or be ready to bring dead characters back to life.   
* When Omega is below about 10,000 HP, it will start using nastier attacks more consistently, like Omega Rays, Lightning, HyperDrive, Beam, and Blaster.  
* Omega has 55,000 HP, although this amount doubles when your party is above level 55\.   
* Omega will also start healing itself more frequently above level 70\.

**ITEM GAINED:** There is a 1/8 chance of obtaining a HyperBlaster as a rare drop, or you can also try to steal one for the same chances.  The HyperBlaster is simply Gogo's best weapon. It has a 25% chance of dealing a critical hit along with a random HyperDrive special. Twin Sword is no longer randomly used with the HyperBlaster, but HyperDrive is far superior anyway and deals about twice the damage of Twin Sword. 

**Colosseum Item:**  You may also trade the HyperBlaster at the Colosseum for Umaro's best weapon: the Lunar Hammer. The Lunar Hammer pierces defense, randomly attacks all monsters with Meteo, and boosts Umaro's magic power 25%, which stacks nicely with the Blizzard Orb to make his Ice Storm very powerful (as well as Gaia).

**RAGE:** Omega has an incredibly useful universal rage, which is 50% Omega Rays and 50% HyperDrive.  Omega Rays targets all monsters with non-elemental, defense piercing damage.  HyperDrive is the most powerful single-target move Gau has, will never miss, and pierces defense. If you ever aren't sure which monster to Rage with Gau during a fight, you can't go wrong with Omega\!

**Atlas:** Found in the Guardian room area with the save point after the room with 3 buttons, the same area as Arch-Beast (1/16 chance). 

* This is the most difficult of the four "common" Kefka's Tower beasts. I would recommend a level of 45-50 to win this battle.   
* Atlas is immune to Fire, Ice, Lightning, Poison, and earth attacks, and has high magic and physical defense \- although it's still possible to deal decent damage with an offering and some powerful swords, or the powerful katanas, or the most powerful claws.   
* Other than that, I would recommend defense piercing moves. Atlas will regularly use powerful attacks such as Quasar (which Strago can learn), Merton, Comet, Meteor, and more. Be prepared to bring characters back to life\!   
* Once Atlas gets below about 15,000 HP, he will use Quasar, Inferno, Merton, and more consistently. End the fight as quickly as possible at this point.   
* Atlas has 65,000 HP, but if you are above level 60, his HP doubles to 130,000.

**ITEM GAINED:** You have a 1/8 chance of obtaining the "Orb of Zemus" \- one of the best relics in the game. You also have a 1/8 chance of stealing one \- but keep in mind you CANNOT run from Atlas, so you must still win the battle even after you steal one.  Orb of Zemus is basically a combination of Marvel Shoes, Muscle Belt, Crystal Orb, Sniper Sight, Sneak Ring, and Cat Hood all in one.  It also grants image on top of all that.  

**BLUE MAGIC:** One of the few ways to learn Quasar for Strago is Atlas. Make sure you beat Atlas with Strago in your party, or alternatively have Gau pick up the rage. Quasar is more powerful than Grand Train, is non-elemental, and defense piercing.  It costs a LOT more MP than Grand Train \- so an Economizer, Gold Hairpin, or Crystal Orb might be wise (or Orb of Zemus if you have one).

**RAGE:** Atlas has a 50% chance of Gau using Quasar, or a 50% chance of x4 Battle attack.  Although the x4 Battle isn’t as powerful as x4.5 of Iron Giant, Quasar is Gau's most powerful multi-target spell with any rage. This makes Atlas a good all-around rage for either boss fights or mobs of monsters.  If you give Gau an Adamant Fist, his x4 Battle attack can also use Rock Slide.

**Colosseum Tip:** If you somehow end up with more Orbs of Zemus than you need, you may bet them for Safety Bits, which can be bet for the Dragon Horn, and the Dragon Horn for a second Ace Shot. This works well with Setzer and a Genji Glove, although he has to sacrifice a shield of course. You can also get this same chain of items by betting the Kupo Shades or Pug Gavel (see the Haniwa section above).

**The Rift Island Beasts (Recommended Party Level 60+):**

* If you haven’t discovered the new island yet, now is the time to travel to the southwest corner of the map (see the Rift Island section above). In addition to being the home of some commonly missed rages for Gau, this island also has the mysterious encounter called the “Rift Spawn”. The purpose of this monster is to summon nasty beasts from beyond the rift; however, it will only work after you have defeated the corresponding beasts in Kefka’s Tower. If you have defeated all 4 Beasts in Kefka’s Tower, this will unlock 4 even more powerful beasts on the Rift Island.    
* You will want to make sure your characters have some good equipment by this point.  Consider farming the Orb of Zemus, Paladin Ring, Adamant Fist/Adamant Mail and more to increase your chances of winning these battles. Even then you may lose some of these fights while figuring out how these Beasts operate.  
* It should be noted that some of these higher ranking beasts will ALSO appear in Kefka’s tower if your level is high enough.  In general, you must be above level 70 for them to appear. The game will determine this by randomly scanning one of your four party members.  If that party member is above the level in question (usually 70), then the higher ranking beast may appear.

**NOTE:** There are no rages for these high-level beasts. However, there is ONE Blue magic left to learn\!

**Arch-Fiend:**  In order to unlock this beast, you must defeat at least one Arch-Beast in Kefka’s Tower. On the rift island, you must then go to the forest area and search for the Rift Spawn. It will spawn an Arch-Fiend.

Alternatively, if you are above level 70, you may also encounter this beast in the Guardian room area of Kefka’s Tower (the area with the save point after the room with 3 buttons, the same area as Arch-Beast, 1/16 chance)

* This fight is probably the least intense of the high-level Beasts, but is still quite the challenge.  The key to this fight is to make sure your whole party is protected against fatal magic, zombie, and if you can, petrify. Paladin Rings are the best method at this point to block fatal magic, but of course you can also use Safety Bits, Memento Ring, Shadow-Yoroi, etc..    
* The move you have to worry about the most is "Death Claw", which will instantly kill your characters even if they have fatal magic protection. Be ready to bring characters back to life when this happens.  Arch-Fiend will sometimes cast Disaster, which can also mess up your party if you don't have protection from the ailments.   
* Once you deal about 100,000 damage to Arch-Fiend, he starts "imploding", and will change his form. At this point, Arch-fiend will use less fatal magic and start spamming more powerful spells like Quasar, Meteo, Meteor, Flare, and Dark. The spell you have to worry about the most is Overcast, which will zombify your entire party, EVEN if they are immune to zombie (although instant-death protection blocks it).   
* After the transformation to his "imploding" form, Arch-Fiend has another 60,000 HP (for a total of 160,000).   
* Once you deal another 60,000 HP, Arch-Fiend will proceed to Explode on your party TWICE. Even if you brought his HP to 0, Arch-Fiend will still cause 9,999 damage on two characters by exploding twice, then will finally die.  To win, you must make sure that at least 3 characters are alive at the end, or have Life3 on a few characters.

**ITEM GAINED:** The reward for defeating Arch-Fiend is the "Fallen Guard" (100% drop rate). This armor can be equipped by Locke, Strago, Gogo, and Setzer, and provides the best physical/magical defense for them by far. It also blocks fatal magic, and absorbs poison as well as fire.

**ITEM STOLEN:** You can steal a common Megalixir from Arch-Fiend with a rare steal of Cursed Ring (1/8 chance). Note that you can only steal from the first form of Arch-Fiend.  His second form has nothing.

**Colosseum Note:** If you are having trouble finding Atlas in order to get an Orb of Zemus, you may take the Fallen Guard and bet it for an Orb.  However, you must fight Atlas to do so, which is going to be very hard\!

**Warmech:** In order to unlock this beast, you must defeat at least one Omega in Kefka’s Tower. On the rift island, you must then go to the dry/dead parts of land and search for the Rift Spawn. It will then spawn Warmech.

Alternatively, if you are above level 70, you may find Warmech in the Magitek Test tube area of Kefka’s Tower, or the 3-button room with machines (right before the Guardian room with 3 bridges). There is about a 1/16 chance to find one in these areas.

* The Warmech has the least amount of HP of all the elusive Beasts, but is also the most intense. Speed is the key to winning this battle.    
* The main issue you will have is with his physical attack (which looks like the HyperBlaster). The normal attack will NEVER miss \- even if you have Image. Warmech will spam his normal attack just about every turn and every time he is attacked.    
* The best way to prepare for this battle is to get the physical defense of your characters as high as possible.  The normal attack of Warmech will be no threat for chracters that are about 250 defense or higher.  
* Every time you attack Warmech, there is an internal counter that starts adding up.  When it gets to 10, Warmech will start tossing Super Balls at your party.  As innocent as they look, they can deal a lot of damage, and he can sometimes use 3 at a time.   
* If you let Warmech stay alive after attacking 15 times, he will use even nastier spells like WaveCannon, Launcher, Blaster, and HyperDrive. Due to Warmech's high magic power, these moves will deal a lot of dmage.   
* The main strategy is to have ONLY your powerful warriors attack, and bring down Warmeach in as few turns as possible.  This is one of the few battles I would not attempt to keep every character perfectly healthy, as it may not be possible. Instead, focus on necessary healing/reviving only, and focus on dealing damage.

**ITEM GAINED:** The reward you get from Warmech is the "Mech Helmet" (100% drop). This helmet offers more physical/magical defense than any other helmet, and can be equipped by Locke, Edgar, Sabin, Strago, and Mog. The helmet also grants Shield and Shell as well as evade \+50%, just like Zephyr cape.

**ITEM GAINED \#2:** It should be noted that there is a 1/8 chance of stealing a HyperBlaster from Warmech. This might actually be easier than obtaining one from Omega\!

**Colosseum Item:**  Taking the Mech Helmet to the colosseum will allow you a chance to earn Cyan’s best helmet: The Oni Kabuto. You will have to face Arch-Beast to get it\!  The Arch-Beast fight can be an extremely tough battle and may involve some luck to win, but I suggest the usual tactics with Terra and Morph \+ Life 3 whenever she dies. I’m sure there are many ways to pull this off, however.

**Mazin:**  In order to unlock this beast, you must defeat at least one Adamantor in Kefka’s Tower. On the rift island, you must then go to the grassy parts at the center and search for the Rift Spawn. It will spawn Mazin.

Alternatively, if you are above level 70, you may find Mazin in the big room with the stairs where you also find Iron Giant and Adamantor (after the jail cell room that had Ultima weapon and other various small corridors; about 1/16 chance).

**BLUE MAGIC:** If you face Mazin with your party above level 60, Mazin will have a chance of using the “Quick” magic. If you are NOT above level 60, there is another beast that will use it at any level (see the next beast after this one).   
**NOTE:** Anyone who remembers the “Quick” spell from the original FF6 will note it has been changed to Blue magic to be used by Strago (or Gogo). As such, you should bring Strago with you to learn it. The Quick spell is unchanged: it allows the character using it to have two turns in a row instead of just one. This means if you so desire, you can have Strago cast White Wind and an attack like Beam in the same turn.

**TIPS:** Mazin is very big, and indeed knows how to use that giant sword. His attacks will rarely miss and are powerful, although Image can sometimes work on your characters. 

* Try to have characters with higher physical defense in this party AS WELL as magical defense. Mazin has insane magical power, and will take your party out with basic spells like Flame, Flood, and Blitz. As such, any gear that offers elemental protection will help, such as Paladin Shield, Flame/Ice/Thunder shields, Minerva gear, etc..    
* If your elemental protection is not flawless, equip relics that grant Shell, such as Orb of Zemus, Marvel Shoes, Mech Helmets (if you got any from Warmech yet), or Pod Bracelets. Otherwise, use ShellX or Big Guard as necessary. When you attack Mazin, ONLY use your best moves.  After only taking only 5 hits, Mazin will start flashing colors and become Invincible for a few turns.  At this time, Mazin will heal himself 10,000-20,000 HP, and will sometimes use Step Mine on you.   
* While Mazin is invincible, it will be a good time to also make your own party healthy since attacking will do 0 damage no matter what. Mazin will become vulnerable again shortly, but will once again become invincible after 5 more attacks. This will go on until you deal 130,000 damage to Mazin total.    
* As the battle goes on long enough, Mazin will start to use his special attack, "Purifier", as well as the occasional Rock Slide. These moves will likely kill your characters in one hit, so you will need to bring them back quickly.

**ITEM GAINED:** You will get a sword called the "Purifier" by winning this fight. Purifier is a Locke-specific weapon. It pierces defense, never misses, and is long range. This sword also offers 50% evade, which is even better than the Defender. It can technically work with the Offering, although it will lose the defense piercing.

**Colosseum Item:**  The Purifer isn’t the only posible reward for defeating Mazin.  You may also take the Purifier to the colosseum and bet it for a new ultimate weapon for Terra: The Ethereal Bow. The catch is you must battle Gigantuar to get it\! This is finally a good excuse to ditch Terra’s Ragnarok sword, since the Ethereal Bow offers an even better magic boost and the same MP for criticals effect – but it also allows for a posible multi-strike. The bow lacks the 10% physical evade of Ragnarok, but it boosts Magic block 20% instead to make up for it.

**ITEM STOLEN:** You can steal an Exp. Egg from Mazin, which is a fantastic way to grind in case you need to.

**Tianlong:** In order to unlock this beast, you must defeat at least one Atlas in Kefka’s Tower. On the rift island, you must then go to the desert and search for the Rift Spawn. It will spawn Tianlong.

Alternatively, if you are above level 70, you may find Tianlong in the Guardian room area with the save point after the room with 3 buttons, the same area as Arch-Beast and Arch-Fiend (1/16 chance)

**BLUE MAGIC:** Tianlong has a 1/3 chance of using “Quick” the very first turn. This will allow Tianlong to attack twice in a row. After about 4 turns, Tianlong has another 1/3 chance of using it again. This will repeat until you have delt about 65,000 damage to Tianlong, in which case his pattern will change to something else.    
**NOTE:** Anyone who remembers the “Quick” spell from the original FF6 will note it has been changed to Blue magic to be used by Strago (or Gogo). As such, you should bring Strago with you to learn it. The Quick spell is unchanged: it allows the character using it to have two turns in a row instead of just one. This means if you so desire, you can have Strago cast White Wind and an attack like Beam in the same turn.

**TIPS:**

* This is the longest of the Elusive Beast fights, and also among the toughest. Tianlong goes through many phases, and will change his attack patterns based on his current phase. You will want a party with as much protection against Fatal Magic and all the ailments as possible. Paladin Rings are optimal to accomplish this if you have them.    
* Resistance or immunity to Bolt and Fire will also be helpful (via shields), or at the very least, a relic that grants Shell/Shield like Orb of Zemus.   
* TianLong's phase will change each time you deal about 60,000 damage. His first phase is mostly physical attacks. During this time, Fenrir and Image will be useful. When the second phase first begins, Tianlong will hit you with Ice3, Lightning, and Inferno \- all in a row. During the second phase, Tianlong will hammer you with all the nasty ailments: Pug, Sleep, Petrify, Freeze, and more. This phase will also include the occasional Comet, Merton, Meteo, Flare, and Dark. Before his 2nd phase ends, you will want to try to fully heal your party and/or use Life3 on some characters.   
* After you deal about 120,000 damage total, Tianlong will change his form and enter his 3rd phase (the music will also change here).  Tianlong will immediately use Goner upon entering his 3rd phase, which will deal anywhere from 3,000-7,000 damage to your entire party depending on your character's magical defense and whether or not they have Shell. At this point, you should focus on healing a bit. A dedicated healer or two in your party goes a long way. Strago's White Wind helps immensely. Tianlong will proceed to use spells like Inferno, Lightning, Comet, Meteo, Flare, Meteor, and possibly even Quasar.   
* After you have dealt about 180,000 damage, Tianlong will enter the 4th and final phase. This phase is mostly the same powerful spells from the 3rd phase, but more frequent.  Once you get Tianlong below 24,500 HP, he will use Overcast on your party.  If you aren't immune to fatal magic, the counter will begin, and turn anyone with numbers above their head to a zombie. At this point, you should focus all your characters on attacking to finish off Tianlong.  Keep your characters healthy, as Tianlong's final death move will be Goner one last time.   
* In total, Tianlong has about 240,0000 HP.

**ITEM GAINED:** The reward for slaying the toughest dragon in the game is the Dragon Ring. This relic grants Life3 to the wielder at the start of the battle (only once), and resists all elements 50%. It can be equipped by all characters.

**Colosseum Item:**  The first thing you might want to do after obtaining a Dragon Ring or two is take it to the colosseum. Betting the Dragon Ring will offer you the chance at winning the Empress Gem. This is the ONLY way to obtain X-Magic, and ONLY for Celes. If you thought Celes was lacking as an endgame character, she should now be at the top of her game\!  Just be warned: you must solo fight Omega to pick up the Empress Gem. Omega can use “Quick” during his fight at the colosseum, which allows him to attack twice in a row. You can probably win this fight with Terra. Use Life3 any time she dies, and attack Omega with her Ethereal Bow if you got one. Have her heal herself when low on HP, and Morph if you want to deal even more damage.

**Rift Beast, the FINAL beast (Recommended Party Level 70+):**

By this point, you have probably noticed there is a Rift Spawn in Kefka’s tower. This Rift Spawn serves only one purpose, and that is to spawn the final beast.  In order to unlock the final beast, you must defeat all 4 high ranking beasts: Arch-Fiend, Warmech, Mazin, and Tianlong.  You can find the Rift Spawn just about anywhere you found the previous beasts in Kefka’s Tower, such as the Guardian room with 3 bridges, the machine room with the 3 buttons near the end, and many other areas. There is usually about a1/16 chance in these areas on average.

* Rift Beast will mostly use magic with just a few physical attacks mixed in. As such, it is recommended you equip relics and gear that help you with your magic defense.  Most of Rift Beast's spells will completely ignore defense however, so Dragon Rings may actually be a better choice for the Life3 status.   
* The key to this battle is patience and good observation. Rift Beast will begin "charging" at the start of the battle.  During this time, Rift beast will not attack you unless you attack it. The counter attacks can be very nasty, however. During this phase, you must ONLY use your very best warriors.  
* If you can, try to deal more than 9,999 damage every attack. Some methods of dealing this much damage include Genji Glove with x2 powerful weapons, x-magic with Celes, Quick with Strago or Gogo, Quadra Slice with Cyan, Kupo Shades with Moogle Disk, a Dragoon with a Dragon Horn, a Pug with x2 Pug Gavels, and probably more I am forgetting about.  You will need to heal between attacks when Rift Beast counters. During this time, you will also want to cast Life3 on all your party members.  
* Every time Rift Beast has a turn or you attack it, an internal counter goes up by 1\.  When the counter reaches 18, Rift Beast will start flashing and gain invincibility. You then have just one turn before it uses Fallen One, followed by Meteo. You might survive this, but it’s also possible nobody will survive without Life3\!   
* Once Meteo is through, Rift Beast will proceed to spam powerful spells and single-target attacks every turn. Rift Beast will remain invincible for about 4 turns while it throws everything at you.   
* The final move before Rift Beast removes invincibility is Ultima. Your entire goal during these 4 turns is to merely stay alive\! Once the 4 turns are over, Rift Beast will begin charging again, the counter will reset to 0 and slowly count back up to 18 like before. It might take you 2-3 cycles of this before you can slay the beast.  Rift Beast has about 200,000 HP in total.

**ITEM GAINED:** The reward is the "Cyber Bracer", which grants dual wield and 50% evade. The Cyber Bracer Also offers 40 physical and 40 magical defense \- which is about same as a moderate Shield. In other words, Cyber Bracer is a Genji Glove, Shield, and Zephyr cape in one. 

**NOTE:** At first, the Cyber Bracer may seem like a pointless endgame item until you see WHO can equip it, which is Gau, Umaro, Cyan, and Sabin. These characters are likely lacking in defense if you have them using Genji Gloves, and the Cyber Bracer is the solution to that. The biggest surprise here is Gau and Umaro being able to use it, since both cannot equip a Genji Glove. With certain rages (Iron Giant for example) and TWO Adamant Fists, Gau could potentially deal 40,000 damage in one move (if he does the special move with a Rock Slide x2). Likewise, Umaro could potentially deal 40,000 damage if he strikes with two Lunar Hammers and they both use Meteo. Of course, they won’t be doing this much damage every turn, but the potential is there.

**Colosseum Item:** You may also take the Cyber Bracer to the colosseum for a chance of obtaining another ultimate weapon for Setzer: The Omega Shot. You would have to face Haniwa to pull this off.  The good news is that Haniwa is a little more forgiving against only one party member compared to when you faced him in the dino-forest.  The Omega Shot is simply an upgrade over the Ace Shot.  It consistently deals higher damage, and can randomly cast Omega Rays on all monsters. Give Setzer two of these with a Genji Glove, and he will be quite the force to be reckoned with\!

**Elefenrir, optional final beast (Recommended Party Level 70+):**

So, it is sort of a lie that the Rift Beast is the final beast – at least as of version 2.0 of the hack\! There is in fact one more optional beast you may fight, but only once.  Defeating this beast rewards you one of the best weapons of the game, but other than that, you won’t unlock anything else by winning this battle. In order to unlock this beast, you must defeat the Rift Beast. You must then encounter the Rift Spawn either in Kefka’s Tower or back at the Rift Island to make this last beast appear.

**BLUE MAGIC:** You have probably already picked up the Blue magic “Quick” from either Tianlong or Mazin by now, but in case you haven’t, you may also learn it from Elefenrir. Read the section from the other two beasts above to learn more about it.

* First and foremost, Elefenrir will use Ultima on turn \#1 before your party can do anything at all, dealing 9,999 damage to each party member and ensuring game over.  That is unless you equip one of those Dragon Ring’s you should have obtained by defeating Tianlong\!  Doing so will bring a character back to life with Life3.  Be sure to equip the Dragon Ring on at least one character that has access to life and/or can use a phoenix down on someone who does.  
* As tempting as it is to equip Dragon Ring’s on all characters, you kind of need to use those valuable relic slots for Paladin Rings and other useful relics (like Orb of Zemus, Economizer, etc.)  Elefenrir will actually give you a full 3 turns to revive everyone after Ultima, and he won’t use it again the entire battle.  However, Elefenrir will proceed to use many instant death attacks and attempt to inflict status ailments on your party.  In order to block all this, I recommend having a Paladin Ring on all 4 characters in this battle.  
* Once you have survived Elefenrir’s first Ultima attack and revived all party members, I recommend having a mage consistently cast Life3 on everyone.  Whenever someone dies, bring them back and use Life3 again.  This is because Elefenrir does have a chance to use other nasty attacks that, although not as powerful as Ultima, can still kill everyone if you get unlucky enough.  
* If you are struggling with this battle, I recommend having two mages heal by using Cure4 and/or White Wind along with Life3 every single turn while your other two characters attack. Be sure they deal 10k damage every time at least.  
* Elefenrir has about 500,000 HP in total. Once he is down to about 65,000 HP left, he will use either Fallen One, Train, or Meteor.  The very next turn, he will attack 4 times in a row. If you are unlucky enough, he can get your HP down low enough to kill each party member with these 4 attacks. This is why I suggest keeping Life3 on all party members, so you have a chance to come back and continue the fight.  
* If Elefenrir survives for about 4 turns below 65,000 HP, he will use Dark Sword, which is also very powerful. For this reason, you will want to make sure you attack like crazy when Elefenrir is below 65k HP, and finish him off quickly at this point.

**ITEM GAINED:** The reward for defeating Elefenrir is the “Mastermune”, a Cyan-only sword. You may notice is has a question mark in the description.  So, what does it do? Well, I think the right question is what DOESN’T it do? This sword pierces defense, can multi-strike, never misses, boosts attack 25%, Vigor 50%, Magic power 25%, and works long range from the back-row. On top of all that, it also boosts many other stats like evade and even magic block. If you have Cyan only using one sword, this is the one you will want him to have.  If he has two swords with a Genji Glove or Cyber Bracer, I recommend giving him the Mastermune and Zanmato.

**NOTE:** Cyan is the only character that can have two multi-strike weapons (Zanmato and Mastermune). However, keep in mind he will not be able to get any more than 5 hits per turn (his 2 normal hits \+ no more than 3 multi-strikes). If his first sword multi-strikes all 3 times, then his second sword will not be able to multi-strike at all.  As such, I suggest placing the Matermune in his right hand so it hits first (since it is the more powerful sword of the two). This will maximize his damage potential.

## **The Final Battle with Kefka**

**SPOILERS:** You can face up to 3 iterations of Kefka in the final battle, depending on how many beasts you hunted/killed. 

* The first iteration is the “default” Kefka, and behaves the most like the original FF6. This default version of Kefka can of course be fought at any time, regardless of whether or not you completed any optional quests or hunted any beasts.  
* The second iteration of Kefka will appear after the default first iteration is killed, but ONLY if you have hunted and destroyed the 4 beasts of Kefka’s Tower:  Arch-Beast, Omega, Adamantor, and Atlas.  
* The 3rd and final iteration of Kefka will appear after the second iteration, but ONLY if you defeated the Final Rift Beast. This effectively means you also had to kill the other 8 beasts to do so.   
* In short, if you want to fight ALL 3 iterations of Kefka, just make sure you killed a Rift Beast\! 

**Tier 1 and 2 leading up to Kefka:** There isn't really any particular strategy you have to follow beating the first two tiers. 

* The easiest way to win is to attack all targets on the screen with Ultima, Quasar (if you learned it) or Grand Train, Meteor, etc...  Use White Wind, Cure3, or X-Potions/Elixirs as needed to keep party members healthy.    
* If you don't have a mage in your group, simply use your most powerful warriors to take out targets individually, as quickly as possible.

These tiers don't have many differences when your party is at higher levels, and will merely get easier.

**Tier 3:** This is the only tier that involves a bit of strategy. 

* Kill the Lady on top first, or she will keep reviving "Rest".  On higher levels, she’ll use Life3 on herself, so keep at it until she fails to bring herself back to life.   
* Once you have Lady out of the way, keep your party members healthy each time you attack Rest, as he will counter often.    
* When he dies, he will counter with up to 3 fatal attacks, so try to keep all 4 party members alive before inflicting that final blow against Rest.

**Kefka Battle, default (Recommended Party Level 40+):**

* I recommend casting ShldX/ShellX or Big Guard right off the bat.  If you have the Fenrir Esper equipped, use it for the Image status.   
* In the very first move, Kefka will use Fallen One. This would be a good time to use a Megalixir that you have (hopefully) been saving to this point. If you don’t have one, use Cure4 and/or lots of Exlixirs.   
* I would then focus on defense piercing moves.  Examples include Drill, Pummel (or Bum Rush if you are confident), Dispatch, Ultima, Quasar/Grand Train, Beam, Ace Shot, Ninja Stars, etc...  I do NOT recommend using Chainsaw, Quadra Slice, or Flare \- since these moves could miss Kefka with his high evasion rate.   
* If you have a sniper sight (or the incredibly rare Orb of Zemus), equip it on Leo or Cyan and have them attack with Offering and their best swords.  The damage output should be decent enough.  Umaro can just attack normally.    
* Once Kefka is below 30,000 HP, prepare to defend against his Goner attack. It would help if you manage to get a Blue mage in your party to repeatedly cast White Wind while other party members use their defense piercing moves.  Otherwise, use Cure4.  
* Use Life2 whevever needed, and if you have any Megalixirs leftover and are in a tight situation, use them\!  Eventually, Kefka should fall.   
* If you are at level 70 or above, Kefka will no longer use Goner below 30,000 HP.  Instead, he will just spam powerful attacks every turn.   
* If you have unlocked the second iteration of Kefka by defeating the 4 beasts, Kefka will use Goner when he is dead, and will call in his second form.

**Kefka, second iteration (Recommended Party Level 50+):**

This iteration will only appear if you defeated the 4 beasts: Arch-Beast, Omega, Adamantor, and Atlas. You will fight the second iteration of Kefka after the first/default one is beat.

* If you want to have a chance at winning this, get your characters who face him above 8,000 HP at least, or prepare to use Life3 a lot. Equip muscle belts, red caps, and other items with HP boosting properties to accomplish this. Your chances of winning are much higher if you collected some of the endgame ultimate gear (see the beast hunting section before this).  
* Try to have at least one Blue mage and one regular mage when you reach Kefka. I also recommend obtaining a handful of Megalixirs from the Auction before tackling this battle.  
* When the second version of Kefka first appears, he will use Fallen one again. Have a Megalixir ready for this.    
* Do NOT waste your turns with weak attacks, since there is aproximately a 1/3 chance Kefka will heal himself 9,999 HP with white wind on top of countering your attack with battle, Special, Shock Wave, or HyperDrive. If you can, try to deal 9,999 damage each attack. Defense piercing moves should accomplish this (Drill, Dispatch, Pummel, Ninja Stars, etc..) as well as your most powerful spells (Ultima, Quasar, etc..)  Have your warriors perform multiple attacks with offering, genji gloves, etc.    
* Gau could have an Adamant Fist equipped if you obtained one to perform multiple strikes. Good rages include Gigantuar, Atlas, Haniwa, Arch-Beast, Iron Giant, Adamantor, or Brontaur (although I'm sure there are others).   
* If Leo is in your party, give him Excalibur with the Dark Eternal sword (if you got it).  
* Once Kefka is below 30,000 HP, he will prepare to use a more powerful move than Goner, and that is a new spell called "Chaos". This spell will deal 7,000+ damage on every character, despite their magic defense. You need to have them healed above 8,000 HP at this point of the fight\!  
* Once Kefka uses this move, your best chance is to quickly heal with Megalixirs and continue attacking with your most powerful moves.   
* After using Chaos, Kefka will use another powerful spell such as Ultima, Quasar, or Train. You have one more turn after this as a chance to heal before Kefka once again uses Chaos. This process will repeat until you either win or lose the battle.

**Kefka, third iteration (Recommended Party Level 70+):**

This 3rd and final iteration of Kefka will only be unlocked if you defeated the final Rift Beast (see the beast hunting section). You will fight this final form after you have defeated the first and second forms of Kefka.

This iteration of Kefka has more HP than any other monster/beast in the game, so be prepared\! To be properly prepared, you will want to have many of the items/relics/equipment mentioned in the "Beast Hunting" section: Paladin Rings, Dragon Rings, Orb of Zemus, Cyber Bracer, Purifier, Adamant Fist, Adamant Mail, and more.  The ultimate weapons will also help immensely.

* As soon as the 3rd iteration appears, it will use Goner on you \- causing anywhere from 3,000-7,000 damage.  After this, the 3rd iteration will cast Wall Change on itself. This will cause a random weakness and strength to be granted, which will also completely change the script of the monster based on which strength/weakness was given, similar to Number 024 in the Magitek facility.   
* The difference here is that it will use spells that are based on its own weakness, instead of the opposite.  For example, if the weakness is fire, it will use attacks like Inferno, Meteo, Blaze, etc...  The trick here is not really to focus on the weakness of the 3rd iteration, but rather to understand what attacks it will use.   
* Regardless of what the weakness of the 3rd iteration is, I recommend using your most powerful warriors to attack.  Examples include Leo with Dark Eternal and Excalibur, Cyan with Quadra slice or Mastermune, Gau with his best rages and 1 or 2 Adamant Fists, Umaro with Lunar Hammer(s), Setzer with x2 Ace Shot/Omega Shot, Sabin with Cyber Bracer and x2 claws, Locke with a Purifier or two, Mog with Kupo Shades \+ Moogle Disk, Terra with Ethereal Bow, Celes with x-magic, Strago and Gogo with Quick \+ defense piercing moves, a Dragoon like Edgar with a Dragon Horn, or a Pug with x2 Pug Gavels with a Genji Glove.  
* No matter which script the 3rd iteration is using, you will want to keep a healer active.  Either Strago/Gogo with White Wind, or Terra/Celes/Relm with Cure4.  Bring dead party members back with Life2 when necessary. Don't hesitate to use those Megalixirs if you have any left when you are close to death.  
* When you attack the 3rd iteration about 6 times, it will flash red and play a sound.  You then have one turn to heal before it uses Chaos, which deals an average of 9,000-9,500 damage to ALL party members regardless of their defense.   
* After you have dealt a whopping 240,000 damage to the 3rd iteration, it will begin to flash, and the music will change.  This is when it gets serious.  
* The Wall Change status will cease at this point, and a new script will begin. The 3rd iteration will start using powerful spells every turn like Quasar, Meteor, Comet, Ultima, and finally Chaos (after flashing red for one turn). After you have dealt another 120,000 damage for a total of 360,000, the 3rd iteration will begin using Goner, Chaos, and Ultima \- in that order.   
* It will still warn you for one turn with flashing red before using Chaos. At this point, you only have 60,000 HP left to go\!  Once you have done a total of about 420,000 damage, the 3rd iteration will  finally die, leaving you victorious and (hopefully) satisfied that you beat the final form of Kefka\!

**Optional, level 99 Kefka:**  If you want another challenge, get your party all the way to level 99, and all three Kefka iterations will be even harder. There is also a small “easter egg” when facing the final iteration of Kefka… The strategy is mostly the same as above, but will just be a bit more intense and take longer to pull off.  Good luck\!
