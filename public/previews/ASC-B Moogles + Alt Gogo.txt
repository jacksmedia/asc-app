Description: If you are using Flavor B and decide you want Mog/Moogles back AS WELL as the alternate Gogo from Flavor A, apply this patch. The default Moogle theme will also come back. 
In addition, this pack will also change the palette slightly for Locke, Leo, Relm, Gau, Banon, Kefka, and a few other NPC sprites. There is a screenshot showing all the characters
in this folder. 
Also don't forget you can rename Mog and Gogo using namingway if you already allowed the game to pick the new name for him. This patch is NOT for Character pack A, since Mog/Moogles
and the alternate Gogo are already in that pack!

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: 
-Do NOT apply this together with "Alt_Gogo" or "Revert_Moogles". If you only want only Gogo or only Moogles, pick those other patches instead.
-If you are using the "Revert Weapons" patch, apply this one first.  Otherwise, some of the item names will be jibberish.
-This patch may be used together with "Scarab_Relm".
-ONLY USE THIS WITH CHARACTER PACK B! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
