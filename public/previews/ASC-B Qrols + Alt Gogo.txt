Description: If you are using Flavor B and decide you want the "alternate" Gogo from Flavor A (I will not say who it is to avoid spoilers), then apply this patch. 
In addition, this pack will also change the palette slightly for Locke, Leo, Relm, Gau, Banon, Kefka, and a few other NPC sprites. There is a screenshot showing
all the characters in this folder. 
Also don't forget you can rename Gogo using namingway if you already allowed the game to pick the new name for him.  This patch is NOT for Character pack A,
since the alternate Gogo is already in that pack!

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: 
-Do NOT apply this together with "Revert_Moogles" or "Alt_Gogo+Moogles".  If you want the alt Gogo and Moogles, apply the "Alt_Gogo+Moogles" patch instead.
-If you are using the "Revert Weapons" patch, apply this one first.  Otherwise, some of the item names will be jibberish.
-This patch may be used together with "Scarab_Relm".
-ONLY USE THIS WITH CHARACTER PACK B! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
