SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Description: In ASC, there is a special armor worn by Shadow that you may find late-game. This Armor also changes the sprite of any character wearing it into Shadow's sprite. This optional
patch will REMOVE this behavior (Shadow's Armor will still be available, but the character wearing it won't take on the appearance of Shadow anymore).
