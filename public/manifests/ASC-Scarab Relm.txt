This patch will slightly alter the Relm sprite in Flavor B of the hack. This version is the unaltered sprite by Scarab Enigma before I made further edits to it
(this version was included as an option out of request of Scarab Enigma).

WARNING: Do NOT use this patch with Flavor A! Otherwise, you will end up with a very messed up Relm sprite...
