This hack redesigns FF6's ATB system for improved speed, responsiveness, and gameplay balance. This is accomplished by judiciously pausing ATB to allow the command queue to catch up during long animations. At the same time, the hack doubles ATB speed and rates for all status effect timers, which now scale consistently with the Battle Speed setting. The execution delay on several basic commands is removed to increase responsiveness, but is maintained for other commands as an element of gameplay balance.\n
The Active/Wait config setting is still fully supported.\n
\n
Active: Instead of strict ATB pausing during animations, this version allows time to flow during the current animation until someone is ready to act.\n
	-Similar to FF7's ATB in "Recommended" mode, especially with "FF7 Comprehensive ATB Enhancement"\n
	-Battles are faster than ever in FF6\n
	-Agility stat matters without becoming dominant\n
	-Menu dexterity is less punishing than in prior renditions of ATB\n
Wait: Makes battles fully turn-based.\n
	-Similar to FF10's Conditional Turn-Based battle system (see also the CTB Wait Addons for FF7 and FF9)\n
	-Defaults to Modern ATB Enhanced on Active mode\n
	-Pressing "skip turn" advances time slightly for strategy\n
\n
The end result should be a more tactical and robust ATB system which can be tweaked to the user's preference using the patches and in-game config settings.
