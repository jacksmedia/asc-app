This awesome patch is a nice change to the gameplay mechanics by RoSoDude, and has been modified to work with ASC (thanks to RoSoDude). I decided NOT to have it applied to ASC
by default due to how much it changes the gameplay balance and feel of FF6. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this to anyone that wants gameplay that more accurately utilizes
the speed stat of characters and monsters, and disallows the player from abusing attack animations to outpace the monsters. In other words, it allows for more balanced, fair turns.

MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION:  
-There are three flavors you may choose with the ATB patch. For most people, I suggest the "Enhanced" modern version.  This version is a good combo of speed and pausing, and is also
right on par with the original game in terms of difficulty. The "CTB Wait" edition is the same as Enhanced when the game is set to "active" mode. However, "wait" mode will pause time
completely until you take your turn. This is also fair and balanced, but will slow down battles drastically. The "Classic" edition is the toughest by far, and can be quite unforgiving
(especially if combined with "active" mode ingame). This version is the most similar to the old ATB 1.03 that came with previous versions of ASC. Although this might be ok with normal
difficulty, it has been reported that "insane" difficulty is quite unfair with the Classic ATB. You have been warned!

Final Fantasy 6 -- Comprehensive ATB Enhancement v2.00 BETA
by RoSoDude https://rosodudemods.wordpress.com/

Final Fantasy 6's ATB system has some notable flaws compared to other entries in the series. ATB is always running in the background regardless of battle animations,
so commands can quickly pile up on the queue. This functionally caps the effectiveness of the Agility stat. Furthermore, it enables "Wait tricking" abuse with the Wait
mode config setting, where the player enters a command submenu to pause ATB during player animations, but lets ATB resume during enemy animations to gain a turn order
advantage. Finally, the Battle Speed config setting only serves to make enemy ATB speed slower relative to the player, instead of adjusting the actual pace of battles as
the player would expect.

This hack redesigns FF6's ATB system for improved speed, responsiveness, and gameplay balance. This is accomplished by judiciously pausing ATB to allow the command queue
to catch up during long animations. At the same time, the hack doubles ATB speed and rates for all status effect timers, which now scale consistently with the Battle Speed
setting. The execution delay on several basic commands is removed to increase responsiveness, but is maintained for other commands as an element of gameplay balance.
The Active/Wait config setting is still fully supported. This hack comes in three distinct flavors:

1. Modern ATB Enhanced: The new standard. Instead of strict ATB pausing during animations, this version allows time to flow during the current animation until
someone is ready to act
	-Similar to FF7's ATB in "Recommended" mode, especially with "FF7 Comprehensive ATB Enhancement"
	-Battles are faster than ever in FF6
	-Agility stat matters without becoming dominant
	-Menu dexterity is less punishing than in prior renditions of ATB
2. Classic ATB Enhanced: The old version of the hack. ATB pauses during all animations
	-Similar to ATB in FF4, FF5, FF8, or the "nATB" system implemented by Think0028 for FF6 Brave New World
	-Battles are slightly slower than vanilla ATB
	-Agility stat is maximally important
	-Menu dexterity is crucial for turn efficiency
3. CTB Wait Addon: Makes battles fully turn-based in Wait mode
	-Similar to FF10's Conditional Turn-Based battle system (see also the CTB Wait Addons for FF7 and FF9)
	-Defaults to Modern ATB Enhanced on Active mode
	-Pressing "skip turn" advances time slightly for strategy

The end result should be a more tactical and robust ATB system which can be tweaked to the user's preference using the patches and in-game config settings.

The hack is for non-headered US ROMs (v1.0 or v1.1). It is compatible with other hacks like C.V. Reynolds' Bug-Fix Compilation patch or Revised Old-Style Edition.
This hack should be patched on top of those. Several bugfix patches are integrated into this hack to maintain compatibility:
-Assassin's Premature Continuation v0.20 patch
-Leet Sketcher's Rock Bottom v1.3 patch
-Leet Sketcher's Death Row v1.2 patch
-Leet Sketcher's Self Sneeze v2.0 patch
-Leet Sketcher's Invisible Zombie v1.0 patch
-RoSoDude's Quick Fix v1.02 patch

Source files for assembly are included as a reference for other modders.

Changelist:
#### v1.00 ####
-Initial Release
#### v1.01 ####
-Fixed compatibility with 1.1 US ROMs

#### 1.04 ####
-Integrated Self-Sneeze, Invisible Zombie, and Quick Fix patches
-Corrected jump command delay to 112*512 ATB as intended (previously 96*512 ATB)
