This patch will REMOVE the following new weapons in version 2.0 of ASC: 
Pistols, Shotgun, Bows, and Nunchucks.

And replace them with the original weapons from ASC 1.0:
Flails, Dice, Darts, and the Hawkeye.

WARNING: The guide for version 2.0 will have a lot of incorrect item names and information if you apply this patch (especially for the treasures, colosseum bets, and monster drops/steals). Just keep
this in mind as you go through the game with this patch applied.

WARNING #2: This patch is more substantial than it sounds, and does actually change the balance of the game a bit. This is because Guns are bit more powerful than flails,
dice, and darts. Also, there is an endgame ultimate bow for Terra not present in this patch since bows are gone. However, Terra still gets her Ragnarok Sword. In addition,
a new sword found in the floating continent that is effective against large beasts will be gone (instead it will be the original Man Eater).
