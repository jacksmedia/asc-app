This hack redesigns FF6's ATB system for improved speed, responsiveness, and gameplay balance. This is accomplished by judiciously pausing ATB to allow the command queue to catch up during long animations. At the same time, the hack doubles ATB speed and rates for all status effect timers, which now scale consistently with the Battle Speed setting. The execution delay on several basic commands is removed to increase responsiveness, but is maintained for other commands as an element of gameplay balance.\n
The Active/Wait config setting is still fully supported.\n
