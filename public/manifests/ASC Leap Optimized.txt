By default in ASC, Gau no longer has to leap to learn Rages.  He learns them simply by fighting monsters anywhere.  This patch brings back Leap, but in an optimized
form. Gau has to leap on the Veldt with this patch applied, but the battle no longer ends, and he returns to your party after each battle.
You no longer have to wait for him to come back sit through the "I'm your friend" scene every time.

NOTE: Most people will prefer the default ASC behavior which allows Gau to learn rages anywhere.  This patch is only for people that enjoy hunting for monsters
on the Veldt with Gau.  If you don't enjoy Veldt hunting, then DO NOT apply this patch.
