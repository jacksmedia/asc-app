This patch removes all the new music tracks that you hear in towns, overworld areas, caves, dungeons, and more. This is only if someone for some reason doesn't
want the new music. If you want to re-enable the music, just re-apply the main ASC patch file...

NOTE: This does not remove the new battle music.  There is a different patch for that in the same folder. If you use this patch together with that one,
all the new music will effectively be gone.
