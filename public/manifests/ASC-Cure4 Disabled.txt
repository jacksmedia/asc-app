This patch will REMOVE Cure4 from the game, like how it was in version 1.0 of ASC. This means the best Cure spell you will get is Cure3. Furthermore, Seraphim will no longer teach Cure2, also
like in 1.0. Terra and Celes will learn it naturally at level 25, or you will learn it from Starlet in the World of Ruin.
This patch will also bring back the Antdot spell in place of Cure4. 

WARNING: Use at your own risk!  Some of the balancing of 2.0 is geared toward having Cure4 as an option for the ultimate endgame beast hunting. This will make the end of the game MUCH harder.
That being said, I'm sure someone is up for the challenge!

NOTE: if you want ASC to be as hard as blazes, applying the following patches:
-Insane difficulty
-Revert Weapons patch
-No Cure4 patch
